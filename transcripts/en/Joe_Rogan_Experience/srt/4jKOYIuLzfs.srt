1
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,440
Bad motherbutterflyer.

2
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,840
George is just a bad motherbutterflyer
and that's what makes him so good

3
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,140
old school.
Brian,

4
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:44,770
Greg,

5
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:49,770
his little bad mother butterflyer
plants makes him famous.

6
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,813
No,
text

7
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:09,740
me running up a little goes bad when
he's got my gamble at lunch or something

8
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,820
like the class clown pulling daughter.

9
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,990
It's hard to see no door

10
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,660
knocking on your door
and little speck. No,

11
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,650
I was still shooting. I sold nothing. Dot.

12
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,440
I was doing candy up the corner.

13
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,570
That's all I got my ass when I
was 10 years old doing dumb shit.

14
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,660
You got to have some sort of
a, a clean cutoff point. Brian.

15
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,520
We should program that into the beginning
of the first song or first a part of

16
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:54,354
the podcast.

17
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:59,010
I got clean cut off with no music because
we could probably get in trouble for

18
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:00,150
using people's music.

19
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,410
That was ice cube doing dumb shit
you it could be by on the iTunes.

20
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,950
That's where I got it. It's
possible. Brian Count. Brian Callen,

21
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:13,200
Liza fresh from Thailand. Ladies
and gentleman, freshman towers.

22
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,480
I played the trumpet by the way.
I just was thinking about that.

23
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,580
I should have taken an instrument.
Ours,

24
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,860
our podcast is always a
sponsored by the flashlight.

25
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:21,690
And if you go to Joe rogan.net,
there's a link.

26
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:24,170
You Click on it and if you
enter in the code Rogan,

27
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,430
you can masturbate at a discount.

28
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,230
That's butterflying awesome. You ever blast
went into one of these things? Uh, uh,

29
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:34,120
that's a sin. Anyway, Brian, Brian,

30
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,050
play in it clean now
that he's doing films.

31
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,390
Your film just got to watch the image.

32
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,180
It's funny when you do look at your
films for those of you guys don't know.

33
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,710
I think I just came back from Thailand
doing hangover two little movie. But uh,

34
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,740
but it's funny because when you,
and we talked about this man,

35
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,600
like you'd finally do the big film.
You know,

36
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:54,670
you're doing this big film and stuff and,
and you know it,

37
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:56,250
it's like you're your whole,

38
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:59,220
like your desire is to do something
that you've always watched.

39
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,170
You want to be the guy with
the sweaty shirt, with a gun,

40
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:05,080
tears coming down your face on a railroad
track with the wind blowing your hair

41
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:08,980
back. And it's the final confrontation.
We can have the shootout. That scene,

42
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:13,450
that scene in your fantasy takes six
days cause they're shooting half a page a

43
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:13,990
day.

44
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,020
That's what acting in the film as you're
just sitting around while they spray

45
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:20,770
your shirt.
Well as the sweat isn't really working,

46
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:23,530
it's not the same as the shock before.
We've got to change your shirt.

47
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,390
Give us a minute. That light's
not working. We've got,

48
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,910
can you stand to the left a
little bit bro. That's what,

49
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:29,740
that's what do on a big
film is really about.

50
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,850
It's fun though because he ended up
hanging out with some fun people on this.

51
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,780
Generally complain about doing big movies.
Dude, I want to hear that shit. Sorry.

52
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:42,880
Uh, erase sucks now. I didn't, it
didn't suck. I had a great time.

53
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,250
What's the best Gig in Hollywood?
Do you think it's a TV show?

54
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:50,230
Well the best Gig for,
for like as far as like comfort,

55
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:52,030
life, comfort. That's what they said.

56
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:57,060
I think there's no question that it's a
sitcom cause you work 10 minutes a week

57
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,350
and yeah, and, and you make a fortune.

58
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,670
See for me doing a doing a sitcom is,
is uh,

59
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,880
is cake because then I can go do stand
up on the weekends and make you know,

60
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,170
TV money doing that. Yeah. I
mean the best Gig in Hollywood,

61
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:12,580
the best Gig in the show business is,

62
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:15,460
is either being a rock star
or be in a standup comic.

63
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,950
And I'm not sure what beats what,
but you know,

64
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:20,170
there's nothing like doing stand up.
Stars can break up.

65
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:23,450
The problem is they have to rely on a
bunch of other that's exactly right. And,

66
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,770
and I think also, you know when you're,
when you were like a major rock star,

67
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:31,150
you've been singing the same song for 30
years. That's got to get a little tire.

68
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:34,270
Yeah. It's gotta be a weird, cause
it's totally reverse of comedians.

69
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:37,050
Cause with rock stars, nobody ever
wants to hear their new shit. You know,

70
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,600
nobody wants to hear the new
rolling stones songs. No,
no, no. They're like, stop,

71
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,100
stop. Do that. Start me up song again.

72
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,890
Would comedy people don't want to hear
old shit. They want to hear some new shit.

73
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:49,710
What's some new shit to
magic trick because it's,

74
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,850
it's like you got to surprise him.
That's when people laugh.

75
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:53,740
They're constantly could be
coming up with new material,

76
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:54,820
but isn't that a funny thing?

77
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:59,310
It's like the Rock Stars get pigeonholed
into doing all their best old creation

78
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,680
and we, we have to. That's why
David Lee Roth, when he got,

79
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:04,660
when they fired him from
van Halen, he goes, oh,

80
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:07,420
I know Sammy Hagar has got to
sing jump for the next 20 years.

81
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,330
That's the problem with rock stars about,

82
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,770
I'm not saying that it wouldn't
be awesome to be a rock star,

83
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:18,610
but you have to find a group of people
who agree to hang out and be cool with

84
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:23,170
each other in the midst of
like the biggest ego explosion
in humanity's history.

85
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,800
Rockstar. Oh, forget it. But that's the
bit, that's the top of the food chain.

86
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,480
There's the top of the vagina food chain
he had. There's no doubt. Fuck yet is,

87
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:33,580
are you kidding me? It's
not. To me. It's not,

88
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:35,260
I wouldn't have gone awry or rock paper,

89
00:05:35,261 --> 00:05:38,110
scissors over everyone you've
ever met in your butterflying life.

90
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,090
Even when he's a rock star with
that huge head, it doesn't matter.

91
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,610
That doesn't matter. He's got that.
He's got the jobs are rock stars.

92
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,700
Everyone knows he's banging
everybody and it doesn't matter.

93
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:52,960
It's not even them town. He's the
Alpha male butterflying savage. Why?

94
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,770
Cause he's a rockstar son.

95
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,520
Singing songs that make
them emotionally satisfied.

96
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,860
These making them orgasm emotionally,

97
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:05,030
saying all the right shit with the right
tone, the right amount of sensitivity.

98
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,900
Amazing what guys will do to get checks.
How as a player of epic proportions,

99
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:11,890
truly respect. Did he show? He shows up.

100
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,780
He shows up in a black tight tank top.

101
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,790
He's the only guy I can get away with
that. How is he black? Top tank top.

102
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,490
What champion?
I'd get punched in the face,

103
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:24,740
but John Mayer plays
guitar and girls swoon.

104
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,950
My man is just swinging Dick
and given out bubble gum.

105
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,770
Have you seen him do comedy?
It's also about six four I think too.

106
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:33,800
I Hate Everest guy. Handsome
Brian. If you seen it to comedy,

107
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,730
he's done comedy at the comedy store.
I've heard he's done comedy as well. Yeah,

108
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,310
I can't. Yeah. Some guys, look,
there's a pecking order, you know,

109
00:06:40,311 --> 00:06:42,520
I'm the best silver back.
That's all there is to it.

110
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,340
I'm in the tree thrown fruit
while he's taken all my girls.

111
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:51,320
Speaking of which all I could think of
when I saw this video was you the the,

112
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:55,700
have you seen those videos
of the heartbeat eagles and
Venezuela? Oh yes I have.

113
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:00,630
Holy Sean's a take goats. Yeah.
And that let it drop forever. No,

114
00:07:00,631 --> 00:07:03,890
the Harpy Eagles do that.
But the big thing they do is get monkeys,

115
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,840
monkeys and sloths.
Venezuela basically butterflying kill anything.

116
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,100
They're the biggest ego. The biggest
legal there are enormous. And this is,

117
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:15,650
there's a documentary on Youtube.
It is the shit.

118
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:19,160
And I've thought of you immediately
cause you and I are both retards when it

119
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:23,840
comes to animal. He never had more too.
If you heard about his butterflying lions,

120
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,530
we never had these conversations with
anybody more than with you because you and

121
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:32,240
I just sync up. We both kick it to the
next level of retard. I can't get enough.

122
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:34,480
I can't get an that guy cause cause that,

123
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:36,650
that you remember the conversation
we had about those lions,

124
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:39,650
the super lines in Africa that
heat the water buffalo. Yeah,

125
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,330
the giant lines talking
about Brown because,

126
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,380
and I were in like retard
fever pitch right there.

127
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:51,470
Well they used to always think of males.
The females are bigger than males.

128
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,370
They're chunking muscle
lions both like holy butterfly,

129
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:58,080
this is butterflying insane. And
you just get, so that's why,

130
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,700
that's why I got so obsessed with those
champs, those huge 400 pounds champs,

131
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:06,050
those lion eater chess. They found
leopard meet in their faces. What?

132
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,950
Oh and by the way,
they how?

133
00:08:07,951 --> 00:08:12,860
Apparently and they fished with their
own bare hands and they are all gray.

134
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,910
You know that. No, I did not
know that. Great chimps. The
older ones, they're gray.

135
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:20,180
Look, let's just like in that movie Congo
and let me explain something to you.

136
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,870
When you buy a champ for anybody who
wants to buy a champion, I one call.

137
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,330
Here's the problem.
You don't,

138
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:28,850
you don't want something with seven times
the upper body strength of a grown man

139
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:31,340
with a three year old's brain.
It's prone to rage. Okay.

140
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:35,630
Cause they go for the face
and the genitals. Yeah. Yeah.
That's what they do. They,

141
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:39,410
the guy at the San Diego Zoo go, no. A
chimp says solve everything with violence.

142
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:43,010
They go for the, the face and the genitals
cause they don't want you to breathe.

143
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:47,050
So they're, they're pretty vindictive.
That's great. They really are like a,

144
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:50,840
it's like a 500 pound man. Right.
That's what they say. Well let me,

145
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,530
let me give you an example. They took
140 pound female in the Bronx Zoo.

146
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,000
A long time. 140 pounds. Okay.

147
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,810
Now MailChimp's get up to about 200
pounds is 140 pound female adolescent.

148
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,630
They taught her that the more
she pulled with one hand,

149
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:04,441
they strapped her to a chair,

150
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:07,770
the more she pulled with one hand the she
had the sweeter or the fruit that give

151
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:09,480
her, it's supposed to at an
apple, they give our mango,

152
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,360
she pulled 1200 pounds with one hand.

153
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:16,380
She rode 1200 pounds with one hand.
Now think about that for a second.

154
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,850
Do To who are doing the upright
row with three 50 they're crazy.

155
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:25,260
They're monsters. They're huge. 1200
pounds. Her, her tensile strength,

156
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,930
they did a tensile strength. And
whether it's, did they test your grip?

157
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,860
So the 160 pound man has, I'm
a hundred and God, what was it?

158
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,210
It was like 300 pounds or four,
actually a 200 pounds of tensile strength.

159
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:40,050
She had 1200 pounds of tensile strength
strength as well. She could squeeze,

160
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,090
you know, a ball. I don't know.

161
00:09:42,091 --> 00:09:46,210
We are so butterflying weak policies or such.
I was less,

162
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,060
she would fight with Shitty pussies.

163
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,350
I spent three weeks in Indonesia
rehabilitating orangutans. Okay.

164
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,030
I was around,
I'm sorry.

165
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:58,800
It's pronounced orangutan to hear a
butterflying really smart you guys. Holy Shit.

166
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,660
Personal. The forest in
Indonesia. You guys learn a lot.

167
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:07,350
This is about education. Show Tony
about the education. Yo. Yeah,

168
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:11,850
but meanwhile they're ridiculously
strong. That's insane man. It's crazy.

169
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:15,240
Back to Bangkok and that's
140 pound female. Uh, correct.

170
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,570
So a 200 pound male butterflying chart.

171
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,000
How about a 400 pound male
other than the huge ones?

172
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,190
That's why they call him lion
killers. Correct. The, the, the,

173
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:27,840
the most recent expeditions actually
caught one eating a leopard.

174
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,250
They don't know if it killed it,

175
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,850
but they observed them eating
it and they're very elusive man.

176
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,060
They've actually never, I guess they've
only seen like a couple in the wild. Yeah,

177
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:39,030
they've only seen a few in the
wild and they sleep on the ground.

178
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,120
They nest on the ground just
like gorillas. Who wouldn't,
they don't give a butterfly.

179
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,600
Exactly. Good luck everybody.
It's crazy cause it's only a very,

180
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:47,190
very small part of the Congo and that,

181
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:50,340
that part is all filled with civil
war right now. It's very dangerous.

182
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:53,520
So it's really hard to explore
these guys and to get to them,

183
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:58,560
you got to go straight through rain
forest on foot. It's solely penetrable.

184
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:04,050
Penetrable it's insane. And once you're
in there, man, dude, good butterflying luck.

185
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,240
Good luck with poisonous spiders.

186
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,710
Insects you out from the ear out.

187
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:14,310
They will climb into your ears and eat
your butterflying brains. Millions of them.

188
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:17,460
Streams of Ai. It's got to
feel good. Elephants, man.

189
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:21,090
Have you heard of the spiders that are
like that big that are over in like a

190
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:23,820
rack right now that can't like
camel spiders. I've seen him.

191
00:11:23,821 --> 00:11:26,570
I lived in Saudi Arabia.
People those on fear factor.

192
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,750
That's butterflyed up though.
So they eat. I'm like, no,

193
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:35,610
don't say biking numbs you.
Well I would never be on that show.

194
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:39,060
You got to grab them the right way.
Hazing what people do for like the aim.

195
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:43,800
I lead a camel spider and gets stung
in my face. Yeah, getting stung on the,

196
00:11:43,801 --> 00:11:46,890
on the roof of my mouth can't be weak.
There was a lot of shit we did with bugs.

197
00:11:46,891 --> 00:11:47,760
It was ridiculous.

198
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:51,390
Scorpions with made people lie and a
thing is corporate and just get jacked by

199
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:54,480
Scorpions and they got to
Tom and stuff. Yeah. Oh

200
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:57,860
yeah. Those big black ones
that were really scary.

201
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:00,130
Those are apparently are not as dangerous.

202
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,300
Really dangerous ones with the small
brown ones. Some of the small brown ones,

203
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,930
but the big black ones, it's like a bee
sting. What were those fluorescent ones?

204
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:11,320
They were like green caterpillars that
just burst every time you meet somebody

205
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:14,740
would chew on them. Like they're
Lewis, huge tomato hornworms.

206
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,920
Those things are crazy.
Fluorescent Green and it's so,

207
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:20,500
if you're really trippy here in the wild,
if you're in the wild,

208
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:23,710
is there any bug you can't eat? Is
there? I'm sure there's a lot of them.

209
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:28,810
The one when bugs are really bright,
bright, and colorful most of the time.

210
00:12:28,811 --> 00:12:30,010
That's a big warning.
Yeah.

211
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,270
It's a big warning that
there's some poison in this
motherbutterflyer. Like, you know,

212
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,060
look at this bitch pet back the butterfly up.
Yeah, you don't see me. It's both of us.

213
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,420
There's suicide bombers.
You eat them and that's really what it is,

214
00:12:40,421 --> 00:12:42,760
is to discourage predation.
Nature's porn star.

215
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:45,630
You don't want to eat caterpillars.
Apparently. Those are those.

216
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:51,920
They're really bright and pretty,
or Hornets, caterpillars, my whole,

217
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,790
all those butterflying things were just
so lucky. They're small. Fuck,

218
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,730
won't you imagine if Hornets
were giant like a horse?

219
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:02,560
It was a size of a butterflying horse dude.
You alluded him.

220
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:06,790
Never evolved to this point. I guess
they would just come down and just Jack,

221
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,250
you bite your butterflying head off
and eat your body. Yeah, they did.

222
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,121
They would just do that.

223
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:11,940
It would just do that and would
be nothing you can do about it.

224
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:16,030
It never developed to the point where
if, if those animals existed, let's,

225
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:18,290
we learned how to ride
them. No. Are we high rate?

226
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:19,510
We're just going to be fine as butterfly.

227
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:23,900
If it wasn't for that Goddamn asteroid
that killed all the dinosaurs, do it.

228
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:25,960
It never, we would never
have gotten to this position.

229
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:30,250
We had to start from scratch and then
have a, a new race with the mammals.

230
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,810
I tried to get to the
top of the food chain.

231
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,840
If there was giant flying butterflying hornets,
the size of horses,

232
00:13:34,841 --> 00:13:36,340
we would've never made it this far.
I don't know.

233
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:37,960
You'd have to go walk
around with a flame thrower.

234
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,230
I don't know if that would work. I don't
know if that works on a regular morning.

235
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,540
Those things are no joke. Yeah
man. They would find that you,

236
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,000
if they find you like in a a big
butterflying swarm of them found you.

237
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,520
They found out where the people are.
You ever watched that video there,

238
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:52,940
these gigantic Hornets and the Japanese?
Do you want to do mine?

239
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,430
I don't want to go into that 50
times butterflying you might have,

240
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,960
I mean the sixth Japanese,
Yellow Hornets,

241
00:13:58,961 --> 00:14:02,530
they're the biggest member of the Horn
of family that came in and killed 30,000

242
00:14:02,531 --> 00:14:04,780
bees in a period of three hours.
Is that what you mean?

243
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,990
That video heads off ladies and
gents already thousand bees.

244
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,760
It would would be the youtube search
for that Japanese Hornets Kisco.

245
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:16,540
He'll go to go to hornets versus
B versus B. As you gotta see this,

246
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:20,470
and imagine if they were big
and by the way, these things,

247
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,890
they have close up on this thing and
you watch these bees doing whatever they

248
00:14:23,891 --> 00:14:27,890
can. And the only time, this is what
it was so creepy, those Japanese worn,

249
00:14:27,891 --> 00:14:32,140
it's what they'll do is they'll send a
scout out and when the scouts sees the

250
00:14:32,141 --> 00:14:35,290
hive it drops like a hormone,
like a,

251
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,410
like a scent trail on the hive
and then goes flying back to its,

252
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,330
you know its nest and then,
and then,

253
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:44,020
and then the troops come out and
they come out and then they just,

254
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:47,950
they just eat the bees, how, what they
do. But sometimes what the bees get,

255
00:14:47,951 --> 00:14:51,830
they get lucky. And what they'll
do sometimes is they will actually,

256
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,950
when they get, when the Hornets walking
around like it's doing right now,

257
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,790
sometimes the bees will jump on it and
they can't sting it cause it's too,

258
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,290
it's a armors too thick.

259
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,470
What they do is they start flapping
their wings around it and they create so

260
00:15:03,471 --> 00:15:07,220
much heat around the horn at that the
horn, it dies because it's too hot.

261
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:10,820
And that's the only time if you can kill
the scout before he goes back, your,

262
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:15,440
your, your colony will survive. If
you don't, then you're all dead.

263
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:19,730
Holy Shit. Yeah. Look
how big, how big it is.

264
00:15:19,731 --> 00:15:23,870
You have to see this spaceship and just
wrap your head around what the butterfly's

265
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:24,710
going on.
We,

266
00:15:24,711 --> 00:15:29,711
I think we discount the insane complexity
of the insect world because there's so

267
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:35,760
little. That's right. But if
they were big, yeah. Well,
buck a trip, this would be,

268
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,500
they're, they're sold
incredibly organized. It's
ridiculous. We're just so lucky.

269
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:42,510
They're little. The defenders
greatly outnumbered the Hornets.

270
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,630
It could have easily yet turned out
that these things were birds, you know,

271
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,470
giant birds.
Well did they tear doctors and things?

272
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:54,290
We had the dinosaurs were essentially
the birds have their closest relatives.

273
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:54,710
They set us.

274
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:58,760
So there's an interesting theory that
I've read recently about dinosaurs that

275
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:03,761
they believe that the size of dinosaurs
is so ineffective given our current,

276
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,970
uh, atmosphere that they think that
it's possibly evidence that there was a

277
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:12,950
different atmosphere on earth when
a different like dogs density to the

278
00:16:12,951 --> 00:16:15,080
atmosphere on earth and
they were cold blooded.

279
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:18,430
It would probably have to be warmer
than it was. Right. You know? Um,

280
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,480
like crocodiles, I mean if you, you
need to see that documentary called,

281
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,480
there'll be here be dragons where you
got those crops that actually bite a

282
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:29,810
Willdabeast around the mid section and
take a man butterflying video when they're

283
00:16:29,811 --> 00:16:33,770
within the Willdabeast walks up to the
palm there drinking and it just explodes

284
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:36,200
out of the pond. That's right.
And that, that's a, that's a,

285
00:16:36,201 --> 00:16:39,290
I don't know how many thousands of pounds,
but that, that is, that's a dinosaur.

286
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,900
That's as close to a dinosaur as you get.

287
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:44,750
It's incredible that that thing is still
alive. They keep living and by the way,

288
00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:45,584
they keep growing.

289
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,560
There's this condition with a reptile
like that where they will just keep

290
00:16:48,561 --> 00:16:50,600
growing more.
They get bigger,

291
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:55,601
they get where they eat cows and there's
a certain sinister quality to the

292
00:16:55,641 --> 00:17:00,350
crocodile that makes it look more
sinister than an alligator even,

293
00:17:00,351 --> 00:17:02,180
you know, it's, it's called a longer,

294
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:07,210
sharper snout and alligators have that
got that round kind of rounder snout and

295
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,640
they tend to eat fish
and smaller animals too,

296
00:17:10,641 --> 00:17:12,730
but they butterflying eat
people and only pay him to,

297
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,760
the guy got killed who was a on a
running from the cops. He crashed.

298
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:19,970
His car is like a Dui in Florida.
Really? Running from the cops,

299
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:20,960
jumped out of his car,

300
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:24,920
jumps into the water just as he jumps
into the wall and the alligator grabs him

301
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:29,690
and butterflys him up right in front of the
car. Is that true? Yeah. I was in the,

302
00:17:29,691 --> 00:17:33,470
I was in Marco Island doing standup and
there's an area in Marco island off of

303
00:17:33,471 --> 00:17:38,471
Naples that has the biggest saltwater
crocodile preserve American crocodiles.

304
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:43,430
And there are signs all over. Don't go
swimming. Do not get out of your boat.

305
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,980
Don't be careful when you're fishing.
All that stuff.

306
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,710
It their crocodiles anywhere
in the area. I'm not, Oh shit.

307
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,350
No, no. We're not going hiking.

308
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,470
Well all you have to do is tap them on
the snout and they're walking with it the

309
00:17:55,471 --> 00:17:57,870
butterfly out of here.
Fucking time. That's the,

310
00:17:57,871 --> 00:18:00,510
that's the biggest lie when I talk
about when a, when a shark attacks,

311
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:04,090
you hit him in the nose, they kill
sea lines with their mouths tried.

312
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,510
It's like hitting the Chevy on that on,

313
00:18:05,511 --> 00:18:08,310
on the mouth when it's coming at you at
30 miles an hour. And on the hood of the,

314
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:11,650
on the hood, they're not worried
about stuff that bumps their nose.

315
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,090
They're going to butterfly you
up. That's just some bribes.

316
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,100
That's great rights. What? That guy
that rides great whites. It's a guy who,

317
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:23,460
Brian's great wines from South Africa
who he was snorkeling with eight great

318
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:26,660
whites in the water and then
wrote a 22 footer shut the fun.

319
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,750
Speaking of which David Blaine butterflying,
I don't know if I can say this cause he,

320
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:32,280
I think it's going to be part of a show,
but um,

321
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:35,070
he does a thing with the great
whites is pretty crazy to do.

322
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,280
You just give it away. I
can't even believe you did,
but it's not, it's nothing.

323
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:40,980
It wasn't it you, I'm not giving
anything away, but he does something.

324
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:42,240
He showed me some pretty cool stuff.

325
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,690
I'll drop big names on this podcast
if I want the whole animal world, man,

326
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:49,260
we so take it for granted because we've
pretty much isolated ourselves from it

327
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,790
with cities.
And you know,

328
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,060
that's the first thing that really
struck me when I was living in Colorado.

329
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,530
Who was hell, you're connected
to the wild world there on your,

330
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:01,320
you cannot remove the
wild world from Colorado.

331
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:05,490
Like when you're driving through town in
Evergreen, there's these photos of, uh,

332
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,100
like elk herds that w Mosey through town,

333
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:12,200
hundreds of elk thousand
pound wild animals,

334
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,820
wild cattle basically. Right?
That's what they're like.

335
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,610
And they're moving through the butterflying
forest and walking down the mainstream,

336
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,110
clogging up traffic. I mean, it's
a trip. I was in Ohio one time,

337
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:24,380
I was swimming and uh,
um,

338
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,300
I watched these poor purposes
like I could, I could not,

339
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,280
I could hear them because they were
probably 50 feet away and they just passed

340
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:33,510
me.
Not Dolphins,

341
00:19:33,511 --> 00:19:37,370
but those huge purple porpoises
just and one I'm surface

342
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,900
and breathe through. It's a, and
I just felt so insignificant.

343
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:44,070
It was like a locomotive,

344
00:19:44,071 --> 00:19:48,450
like it just a bunch of locomotives
just gliding through. It was crazy.

345
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,410
So I called to them,

346
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,010
I'll do the trip about dolphins is
that they're so intelligent and they,

347
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,680
and they have wars with each other
and you can see it when you're,

348
00:19:57,681 --> 00:20:01,290
you're looking at them. There's like
there's some weird connection when you're,

349
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,540
when you're communicating with a dolphin,
when you look,

350
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:06,600
if you're buy a boat and they're jumping
up and looking at you like when they're

351
00:20:06,601 --> 00:20:10,150
trying to play with you and have fun
with you, like one there's like you,

352
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,620
you connecting to them somehow or another
cause like I think what's interesting

353
00:20:13,621 --> 00:20:16,650
about the more intelligent the
animal, for example, chimpanzees,

354
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,040
even even certain birds
but especially dolphins,

355
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,670
the more organized and more
violent they are with each other.

356
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,060
Like a dolphins will
wage war on other door,

357
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,970
Dolphin pods and kill entire pods.

358
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,900
And they didn't know that until they
created this documentary on it where they

359
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:37,380
actually have they sent out like warring
parties. It's exactly like chimps.

360
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:41,880
If chimps have one area of a forest and
there's another family of chimps and

361
00:20:41,881 --> 00:20:42,660
another area,

362
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,660
they'll send mails out that we'll look
for other males when the other and kill

363
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:48,130
him.

364
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,390
It's crazy. Yeah. We're not the only ones
that do Warren animal kick. Not at all.

365
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,520
Not at all. That's why I've
always said to people, man,

366
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:58,150
you gotta be really careful about
wanting the butterflying aliens to land.

367
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,500
Just look at the history of what every
smart thing has done to everything.

368
00:21:02,501 --> 00:21:04,690
Not as smart all over earth.

369
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,700
Every single opportunity nature
has had to express itself.

370
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:13,170
The, the stronger, smarter
things. Fuck the weaker thing.

371
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,500
That's the argument against technology
in some ways for a lot of computer

372
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:16,981
scientists,

373
00:21:16,981 --> 00:21:20,520
when you start creating computers that
are smarter than we are and they start

374
00:21:20,521 --> 00:21:22,500
making computers smarter than they are,
which is,

375
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,430
and then they'd start developing what's
called will, uh, that the question is,

376
00:21:26,431 --> 00:21:28,470
are they going to have a respect
for the biological heritage?

377
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,330
Yeah. I mean, look all over. The what?
The intelligent animals that we know.

378
00:21:32,331 --> 00:21:36,560
Chimpanzees eat monkeys. All
right. Killer whales eat dolphins.

379
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,300
They kill and eat dolphins,
man,

380
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:42,050
and we do whatever the butterfly we want
to do to everything underneath us.

381
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,110
Why would it,

382
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:48,110
what are we expecting the aliens to be
so evolved that they're past the whole

383
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:52,430
rule of nature that expresses itself
over and over again wherever we are.

384
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,550
Everything that's intelligent takes
advantage of everything that's not as

385
00:21:55,551 --> 00:21:57,440
intelligent. Absolutely.
It's just the way it was.

386
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:01,030
Not as strong or not as power and human
beings do it to other human beings. It.

387
00:22:01,031 --> 00:22:01,880
Dot. Yeah. You know,

388
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:05,330
why wouldn't we expect the aliens to just
be coming down here and just butterfly with

389
00:22:05,331 --> 00:22:09,080
us? I think it's a will to power. I think
it exists. I don't know. I'll be ready.

390
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,780
Brian,
what would you do if the aliens landed?

391
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:15,200
What would you do if it all turned
out to be real and that we have been

392
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:17,750
monitored from space by
invisible Aircrafts that

393
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,830
well, it depends what, how they come.
Like if they just slowly land and go like,

394
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,310
Hey, I'm an alien. I just landed, I would
probably be like, hey, what's going on?

395
00:22:24,311 --> 00:22:26,740
You know? But if they just like blow
up, it'd be funny if they were really,

396
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,010
they were really had to come back
to, hey guys, what's going on?

397
00:22:30,011 --> 00:22:33,070
Where the aliens Auntie,
nothing will,

398
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:34,121
you know,

399
00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:36,760
they got to a point where they realized
they had to step in because we were

400
00:22:36,761 --> 00:22:40,630
butterflying up the resources of this world
so bad that they had to reveal them

401
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:42,760
again. It would have to be
their body language, you know?

402
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,380
If they're like just coming
up to me going like, hey,

403
00:22:44,381 --> 00:22:47,770
we're going to have to step in
here. You guys are like, okay,

404
00:22:47,771 --> 00:22:51,130
I guess you could do I try it
again. Try it out, go for it.

405
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,900
I'd ask him to just
think about jet travel.

406
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,740
I'm going to take less time
to travel across the country.

407
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:01,150
You don't want it to take less time. It's
good right now. It's only a day, dude.

408
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:04,570
Relax everybody. Let's not butterflying
start teleport in each other.

409
00:23:04,571 --> 00:23:08,230
Halfway from here to there.
Thailand was like 27 hours.

410
00:23:08,231 --> 00:23:09,700
I don't know what that was.
Was there like weird,

411
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:13,750
like just things everywhere you went
around there. Yeah. Bangkok's interests

412
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,190
saint because it's like
this very, very, um, hot,

413
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:21,390
hot tropical city with a lot of
pollution and a lot of people,

414
00:23:21,391 --> 00:23:23,700
it's just chaos.
But what's interesting,

415
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:27,150
and if you're in the underage sex for 60
bucks, then you know, more power to you.

416
00:23:27,151 --> 00:23:31,700
But I'm not into that stuff or
I am, but I feel so guilty. Uh,

417
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,040
no, no. But I played, uh, you
know, the owner of a strip club.

418
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:39,030
So we shot a lot of those scenes in, in
the sex district, the red light district,

419
00:23:39,031 --> 00:23:43,670
which is you play a new
person and you were, yeah,

420
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:46,160
I mean, I, I'm wearing a
wig. He and I, it's very

421
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,420
much the same.
Anytime Phyllis loves that character.

422
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,940
And I shouldn't say much more than that,
but, but, um, it, it was so much fun, man.

423
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:55,580
And I think,
I really think it's gonna be hilarious.

424
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:59,000
I think it's going to be just as funny as
far as awesome. Yeah. I mean it was so,

425
00:23:59,001 --> 00:24:01,580
they just so went for it in every aspect.

426
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:03,230
I think they're going to
do the same with this man.

427
00:24:03,231 --> 00:24:06,990
I was so impressed with just watching
the credits were butterflying fast.

428
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:10,790
God and Paul Giamatti is in reality.
He's just hilarious.

429
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:14,120
And he was the deal with that Chinese guy.
That's not really his penis.

430
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:18,020
I can CGI, you should have
him on the podcast by the way.

431
00:24:18,021 --> 00:24:20,840
He's a great guy and he loves you. But
I, I'm actually talked to him about you,

432
00:24:20,841 --> 00:24:24,110
but um, uh, that is, I'm not
going to make a comment on that.

433
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:28,190
I'm not sure if that's his actual,
I'm a big fan of him too and I, yeah,

434
00:24:28,191 --> 00:24:31,220
I've seen him talk about it that he,
that really was, it was such a good guy.

435
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:36,260
Is He? Oh, he's a great last one.
He's a real doctor practitioner,

436
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:41,500
a practicing doctor. Holy
Shit in Calabasas, I think
that's where it was. And he,

437
00:24:41,501 --> 00:24:41,761
he's,

438
00:24:41,761 --> 00:24:46,550
he's a straight up doctor and then started
just taking acting classes and doing

439
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:51,551
stand up and he's just
hilarious and fearless and he
just hasn't stopped working

440
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,610
and he was so grateful for where he's
at and he can't believe it. He's like,

441
00:24:55,611 --> 00:24:58,160
I keep all of this, but he's
fearless man. He doesn't care.

442
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:02,840
He'll take his clothes off. He's just,
you know, just funny, funny, funny.

443
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,550
So how did he, how did he break out
of being a doctor? He was just like,

444
00:25:07,551 --> 00:25:09,170
I don't really like
man a doctor that much.

445
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:13,340
When he was acting and doing all these
movies, he was still, he had a practice.

446
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,320
He was still doing like, you know, yeah,

447
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:19,700
he's his wife as a practicing
doctor to holy shit.

448
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,630
How many people are like that? They just
wanted to do something else with their,

449
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,520
butterflying never went for it.

450
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,390
He said they got stuck when it turned
it around that much. Most people, man,

451
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,360
I know. And then a guy like
that who actually says, I'm
going to, you know what?

452
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:35,450
Thanks a lot for medical school debt.
I'm going to be an actor. You know, why?

453
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,190
What are you talking about?
You got to practice now I'm going to,

454
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:41,570
I'm going to chuck this in and I'm going
to become a movie star. He's good man.

455
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:46,370
He'll be working forever. Forever. He's
your go to guy for sure. He's hilarious.

456
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,560
And he's really fun to work with.
That's the other thing I'm starting to,

457
00:25:48,561 --> 00:25:50,840
I was like the guys that work a
lot like Giamatti and those guys,

458
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:54,950
they're just really good people.
Right? Just a blast. They just,

459
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,800
they're just very giving, you know,
they're just, they listened to you,

460
00:25:57,801 --> 00:25:59,350
they react to you. They just, they're,

461
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:03,150
they're just happy to be there and
not cynical about it. Kevin James, um,

462
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:07,070
I did his movies,
zookeeper and his whole staff,

463
00:26:07,071 --> 00:26:11,060
like everybody who was working on the
movie is so friendly. Oh, they're great.

464
00:26:11,061 --> 00:26:15,800
Like so nice. And everyone is like
really appreciative of everyone.

465
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:20,950
It's just a nice fun working environment
and it's like seamless because of that.

466
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,970
And I'm Kevin's that way. Kevin's
a regular guy comes, right?

467
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,890
It all comes down from him, but it's
like, it makes things so much better.

468
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:28,491
You know,

469
00:26:28,491 --> 00:26:31,580
you really like when you're working with
people that appreciate what's happening

470
00:26:31,581 --> 00:26:35,730
and appreciate what they're doing and
appreciate each other, you know, fun,

471
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,040
positive environment. It's
called perspective. That's
why reading like history,

472
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,720
instead of being like,
not talking about intellectual,

473
00:26:41,721 --> 00:26:44,040
but just getting a sense
of what came before you

474
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,510
and how most people throughout all of
history lived short, miserable lives,

475
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:52,740
lives because they didn't have
access to, I dunno, uh, antibiotics,

476
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,300
vaccines, uh, cat scans, all the things
that let us go beyond Abazi running water.

477
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:01,080
I mean, it just goes on and on and so, you
know, you'd lose three of you are like,

478
00:27:01,081 --> 00:27:04,500
Lincoln lost his kid to a
fever. You know, how many,

479
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:06,120
how many famous people
have lost their children,

480
00:27:06,121 --> 00:27:08,220
three of their children at a time to,
you know,

481
00:27:08,221 --> 00:27:11,820
things like diptheria and stuff we
don't even, we haven't even heard of.

482
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:15,870
And so when you have a perspective of
how lucky you are as just somebody with

483
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,660
WHO's never missed a meal,
for example, or who are,

484
00:27:18,661 --> 00:27:21,330
doesn't have to do anything to
get what they want, you know,

485
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:25,290
just stay warm and stay safe and have
representative government. There are,

486
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:27,900
there's nothing to complain
about. Nothing man. Well,

487
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:30,270
there's certainly something to complain
about because got to evolve and get

488
00:27:30,271 --> 00:27:32,370
better.
She can be satisfied with the way it is.

489
00:27:32,371 --> 00:27:34,230
That's what it's completely butterflyed up.

490
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:39,240
I want to know about all this crazy
wikileak shit. You know, it's uh, uh, the,

491
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:42,900
the, the, yeah and, and the
debate. Here's an interesting,

492
00:27:42,901 --> 00:27:43,890
well before you say anything,

493
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:46,650
there's an interesting story that came
up from the New York or rolling stone

494
00:27:46,651 --> 00:27:50,040
magazine said if the New York Times
had received the same information,

495
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:54,390
which is basically all wikileaks did,
would, would we be prosecuting them?

496
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,670
That's the fundamental question is this,

497
00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:01,850
you had a private who made
all this information available
and the private was in

498
00:28:01,921 --> 00:28:04,710
direct violation of military
code that that when you,

499
00:28:04,711 --> 00:28:07,180
when you join the mill and
take an oath and what that,

500
00:28:07,181 --> 00:28:10,110
that private could be tried for treason
because what he did is he took sensitive

501
00:28:10,111 --> 00:28:13,080
information, not top secret but
secret information and he let it end.

502
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:17,930
He just basically deliberately leaked it.
Now I agree with Julian, Julian Assange,

503
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,110
he, if it's proven in court, and this
is probably going to be the defense,

504
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:26,310
the defense is platform. If
Julian Assan just said, look,

505
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:30,870
I was given this information and I
provided a platform for that information,

506
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:34,970
not unlike the, and this is exactly what
the New York Times did they provide.

507
00:28:34,971 --> 00:28:36,930
Now the New York Times,
what they did was they actually,

508
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:42,180
they actually edited out certain names
of people that could be put into harm's

509
00:28:42,871 --> 00:28:46,920
way if it was found out that they were
helping the enemy in those countries.

510
00:28:46,921 --> 00:28:51,480
So in other words, if the CIA has
certain people we pay to get information,

511
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,540
as soon as their names are put out on
the Internet, they are, they can be,

512
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:58,290
their lives can be a danger because the
host country or the country that they

513
00:28:58,291 --> 00:28:59,910
belong to or that they're
betraying or whatever,

514
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,880
they would put them in jail or kill
them or whatever it might be. So,

515
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,070
so that's where,
that's where the dilemma really,

516
00:29:05,071 --> 00:29:09,540
because we're really comes when you just
dump a bunch of information out, uh, it,

517
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,270
it can have representation
to the names of operatives.

518
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,930
The New York Times did the wikileaks did
know Julianne songs just took all that

519
00:29:15,931 --> 00:29:17,940
Info and just let it out really.

520
00:29:17,941 --> 00:29:21,510
So he let out names of operatives at
different countries and he even gave,

521
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:25,230
he even gave a social security numbers
and addresses of soldiers and stuff like

522
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:27,750
that. And the problem with
that is that, you know,

523
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,400
there's one side of the
argument that says, look,

524
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:32,580
there's got to be transparency and
if you're, if you're an operative,

525
00:29:32,581 --> 00:29:35,430
if you work for the CIA, there's always
that risk, you're going to be compromised.

526
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,550
Okay, that's one idea. But
the other issue is how,

527
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,740
why we're all for transparency.
I certainly am.

528
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:45,940
I'm for transparency of government. That's
important. You don't want to give any,

529
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,990
any agency in government too much
power because like any human beings,

530
00:29:49,991 --> 00:29:51,360
just about natural human instincts,

531
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,500
they just become their own gang
and they get as much power.

532
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:56,890
And that's what's the brilliance of
the founding fathers was creating all

533
00:29:56,891 --> 00:29:59,830
different departments that are
competing against each other.

534
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,830
The State Department has their agenda and
they're always trying to undermine the

535
00:30:02,831 --> 00:30:03,820
department of Defense.

536
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:06,490
Department of Defense has its own
problems with the executive and it just,

537
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,470
and that's a beautiful thing because it,
it,

538
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:12,100
it doesn't let anybody have too much
power. But, but at the end of the day,

539
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:16,150
if you're going to take just a bunch
of Info and just dump it in some ways I

540
00:30:16,151 --> 00:30:19,930
think it has, it's first of
all, it's spiteful and I'm
not sure what the point is.

541
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,910
If you want transparency,
that's one thing,

542
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:25,720
but if you're going to be
that irresponsible and put
people's lives at stake who

543
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:26,720
are trying to do a good word,

544
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,320
personal information and they're trying
to do good work out there. You know,

545
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:30,760
when I was in Afghanistan,
those guys,

546
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:34,270
most of those soldiers I was around were
building hospitals and schools say what

547
00:30:34,271 --> 00:30:38,110
you will about the war and say we'll
about the motives and things, but and,

548
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:41,740
and there's an intelligent debate to
be had about the United States and not

549
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:44,930
getting involved in other countries
affairs. We've heard these things,

550
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,240
but the point becomes what are you trying
to accomplish when you dump all that

551
00:30:49,241 --> 00:30:53,890
information out there and what one of
the repercussions might very well be that

552
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:58,950
government agencies have a tough time
getting information from valuable sources

553
00:31:00,281 --> 00:31:01,300
overseas,

554
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:06,100
whether it's in cases of espionage or
whether it's case of national security.

555
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,920
A lot of people now are going to go,
I don't want to talk to you, dude,

556
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,700
I talked to you and I might get leaked
because you have no guarantee that you

557
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:17,380
can keep these correspondence secret.
It's one thing to embarrass politicians.

558
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,960
It's one thing that Vladimir Putin is
called a guy who doesn't have as much

559
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,810
control over as government. All right,
we'll get over that diplomatically.

560
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:27,940
It's another thing when very valuable
sources of information for the United

561
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,920
States all of a sudden are compromised.

562
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:34,180
And then field operatives who are
trying to make the world a safer place,

563
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:38,680
all of a sudden have very tough time
recruiting anybody because nobody wants

564
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:42,700
people to, like I tell you a secret man
and my name now is all of a sudden on, on,

565
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:46,050
you know, uh, in the New York
Times, no thanks. Or it's on,

566
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:49,630
it's on the web and on a website and my,
and the people that I'm betraying,

567
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,531
that's the first thing.

568
00:31:50,531 --> 00:31:52,810
That's the first place they look and
they come to my house and kill me and my

569
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:57,250
family. Nah, sorry. Find
another guy. I'm not, I'm not
working for you. So that, that,

570
00:31:57,251 --> 00:31:59,470
that that becomes an issue and
there are a lot of other issues.

571
00:31:59,471 --> 00:32:03,130
I think that we haven't really even,
we'll see what this, what this means,

572
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,340
that these things take time.
The ripple effect takes some time.

573
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,690
Do you think that there's
any way that the private,

574
00:32:10,691 --> 00:32:13,570
the guy who leaked the information,
the guy who you know in effect,

575
00:32:13,571 --> 00:32:14,410
committed treason,

576
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,970
does any way that you could argue that
if he thought that there were agregious

577
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:22,000
offenses that were being
ignored and swept under the rug,

578
00:32:22,001 --> 00:32:25,000
that it would actually be
unpatriotic to not report them?

579
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,170
It's a very good question.

580
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,910
It's a question that was raised with the
Pentagon papers. It's a question where,

581
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:32,380
when, when it's tricky,
right? Well sometimes the,

582
00:32:32,381 --> 00:32:35,350
your government is saying that we're not
bombing Cambodia and you start finding

583
00:32:35,351 --> 00:32:39,980
out that we're doing, we're doing
exactly that in violation of it might be,

584
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,340
you know, this is the whistleblower
is a whistleblower at debate.

585
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:46,310
It all depends on whistleblowers always
going to have to take responsibility for

586
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:48,440
the fact that there are people in the
government that needs to betrayed,

587
00:32:48,441 --> 00:32:52,460
that are going to call him a scumbag
and tried to prosecute him. I do think,

588
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,320
I think that's a very,
very good question.

589
00:32:54,321 --> 00:32:58,250
I do think that sometimes you are
in a position where you are privy to

590
00:32:58,251 --> 00:33:02,360
information that is either unjust,
illegal or um,

591
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:06,800
but there are channels, there are also
channels and our government to go through.

592
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:11,350
Uh, sometimes you think to yourself the
press might be the last resort. There,

593
00:33:11,351 --> 00:33:15,740
there are other legal channels
that the military provides. Um,

594
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,100
and uh, it's a good question. Uh,
it's a really good question, man.

595
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:22,580
I do think that you have a responsibility
as a human being when you see grave

596
00:33:22,581 --> 00:33:25,460
injustice. I don't think in
this case that was the case.

597
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:29,600
I don't think this private, um, saw
anything grossly injustice back.

598
00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:32,270
Do you think he's just, he just,
it was impulsive. Like what do you,

599
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:37,040
why do you think he did? Uh, you
know, I butterfly that's him. That's him.

600
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:41,870
Let's ask him. Just ask him like hold

601
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,720
or drinking coconut water.
Listen, you don't want to
give her a heads. See Two oh,

602
00:33:50,721 --> 00:33:52,520
coconut water. I love
it. No, what is that?

603
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:57,410
It's a really hard to find coconut
water. I like that. It's clear there's a,

604
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:59,930
there's a Amy and Brian's too
that can be found on that.

605
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:03,500
Why is this hard to find? I don't know.
It's just really popular or it's just,

606
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:07,140
it's 100% natural, new and tonics.
Sorry about that. Ladies and gentlemen,

607
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:10,310
we were in the middle of fascinating
butterflying conversations. Like God damn,

608
00:34:10,311 --> 00:34:13,640
phone has to ring. But that's a, that's
a really good question. And whenever,

609
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:17,990
you know, um, you know, an institution
of power, it's tricky, right? It's like,

610
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:21,950
you know, look what is this this nation
founded on the nation is founded on,

611
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,930
here's a very good question.
Here's a very good question.

612
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,790
What does that founded on true?
If we go back to 2003 and you had very,

613
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:31,430
very good information that there
were no weapons of mass destruction.

614
00:34:31,431 --> 00:34:36,050
For example, if you had top secret
information that, um, that, that,

615
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,340
for example,
we've had,

616
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:40,910
we have no evidence whatsoever that there
are any weapons of mass destruction,

617
00:34:40,911 --> 00:34:45,110
yet an entire nation is being
sold a bill of goods red.

618
00:34:45,111 --> 00:34:47,450
Let's just take that as an example.
Okay. And you knew for sure,

619
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:51,260
because by the way, in 2002, nobody
had any idea. Nobody was really saying,

620
00:34:51,261 --> 00:34:54,740
even on the National Security Council,
on the United Nations Security Council,

621
00:34:54,741 --> 00:34:57,680
nobody was saying Saddam Hussein didn't
have weapons of mass destruction.

622
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,560
They were saying, where are they?
That's what they were saying.

623
00:35:00,561 --> 00:35:03,380
We all assumed he had met in the weapons
of mass destruction because he'd used

624
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:06,860
them on the Kurds in the nineties
poison gas, not just poison gas,

625
00:35:06,861 --> 00:35:10,510
but germ warfare as well. So we had, we
had documented evidence and you're not,

626
00:35:10,511 --> 00:35:13,130
and, and the United States,
United Nations corroborated this.

627
00:35:13,131 --> 00:35:14,660
It wasn't just US intelligence,

628
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:19,930
but we had documented evidence that he
had used and killed a large number of

629
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,780
Kurdish men, women, and children
with, with these horrible weapons. So,

630
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:29,000
so in 2002, when you say, when,
when Bush was saying, look,

631
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,060
this guy has the fourth
largest army in the world. Um,

632
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:37,130
he's acted very responsibly. Started three
wars, two with Iran, one with Kuwait,

633
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,950
uh, which resulted in a million
people, the dead on both sides.

634
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,890
This guy miscalculates all the time.
You tell me what's,

635
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:48,090
what's to stop them from dropping a weapon
of mass destruction into an enemy of

636
00:35:48,091 --> 00:35:51,750
ours? Hands anonymously, like okayed.
Okay. It was a very, it was a, that was a,

637
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:55,470
that was a debate that they talked
about in the war room. Bush says,

638
00:35:55,471 --> 00:35:58,950
you know what? The guy's got
weapons of mass destruction.
Let's make a play. Let's,

639
00:35:58,951 --> 00:36:01,080
let's, let's bring it up in the, to the,

640
00:36:01,081 --> 00:36:04,290
to the United Nations and we're going to
war. If this guy doesn't cough them up.

641
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:06,690
Now let me ask you something.
If you're,

642
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,150
what are, you talked
about? What is going on?

643
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,870
Hold, please hold. Ladies and gentlemen,

644
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:17,540
I hope you're taking notes because
I don't know what I'm talking about.

645
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,330
Story is haunted dude.

646
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:23,300
Do you think coconut water is gonna
become so big that they're just going to

647
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,580
like, they're like coconuts
are going to become rare,

648
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:28,040
like we're going to eat all the
coconuts off the planet? No,

649
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:30,510
I don't because I don't think
it's that popular. What if,

650
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,550
because I mean is that
something that we could run out?

651
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,980
I don't know what happened there folks.
I have my volume turned off.

652
00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:39,360
There's obviously a
butterflying ghost in my house.

653
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,930
Sit in the office late and gentlemen,
the government,

654
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:45,570
the government is letting me know I
can turn up your volume anytime I want.

655
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:49,280
It's the comedy store, abortions,
ghosts, but he's traveling.

656
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,960
But here, here's the final
point. Here's the point.

657
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:55,510
The point and we'll move on is if you,
if you were in a position and you work,

658
00:36:55,511 --> 00:36:56,650
you are a field operative.

659
00:36:56,651 --> 00:37:00,340
You are a CIA guy who were in a panic
on and whatever and you knew for a fact

660
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:03,700
that there were no weapons
of mass destruction or at
least there was no evidence.

661
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:08,820
But to divulge that information would be
to compromise certain national security

662
00:37:09,521 --> 00:37:12,300
secrets. Would you do it? My,

663
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:15,630
my feeling would be that you should do
it might be like feeling would be that if

664
00:37:15,631 --> 00:37:18,370
you're going to stop a war from
happening cause there's no evidence,

665
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:21,960
then maybe you should say something that
you're a butterflying George Clooney moves

666
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,520
you guys.

667
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,380
You're a god Damn George Clooney movie.

668
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:28,920
I don't have enough hair to be George
butterflying you can to to give you some shit.

669
00:37:28,921 --> 00:37:32,130
They put some stuff in. You know
what? They dust my head. Bruce Willis,

670
00:37:32,131 --> 00:37:36,720
important way. Bruce was shaved his
head. He doesn't give a butterfly dude.

671
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:38,160
You could do it man.
This is the movie.

672
00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:42,060
This is the breakout hit gas
less gentlemen. Your stop it.

673
00:37:42,061 --> 00:37:45,870
You're going to stop the war. He's
the guy that talks too much. He's old.

674
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,690
It's an alternate world,
an alternate version of our life.

675
00:37:49,050 --> 00:37:50,190
If you had stopped the war,

676
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,680
if you had known there was no
weapons of mass instruction,

677
00:37:52,681 --> 00:37:55,260
you get on TV and you change the world,
they believe you,

678
00:37:55,261 --> 00:37:59,820
and then it shows what we're really like
now in 2010 or 1111 but it used to that.

679
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,430
That's what's funny is if
you had all the answers,

680
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:03,450
you had all the secrets and how would,

681
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,050
when people really listen to think
you're an idiot. Shut up stupid. Right?

682
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,280
Well that's what Judah
thought about Jesus, man.

683
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,870
That's what they thought about Jesus.

684
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,500
Unless you can provide produce miracles
right there and then even then they're

685
00:38:16,501 --> 00:38:19,500
like, that's a trick. There's
something fascinating about this.

686
00:38:19,501 --> 00:38:23,210
Looking back to a time when
someone had it all butterflying nailed,

687
00:38:23,211 --> 00:38:26,640
we've always done it. It's weird. It's
nostalgia for the, what is that called,

688
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:28,680
the good old days.
Do you think that Dan is,

689
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:32,700
because there's been a bunch of different
versions of civilization that things

690
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:35,440
have crashed and gotten terrible
and then gotten better and crashing,

691
00:38:35,441 --> 00:38:36,274
gotten terrible,

692
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:39,610
so they've always looked back to when
things were great before it crashed.

693
00:38:39,611 --> 00:38:42,370
It's like almost like an
ethic. It's almost like the
way we think, well, you know,

694
00:38:42,371 --> 00:38:46,690
like, uh, they were talking
about it, uh, this, this
fundamentalist Islamic movement.

695
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,010
It's a very new thing in Islam and this,
this extreme extremes who believed that,

696
00:38:51,011 --> 00:38:51,191
you know,

697
00:38:51,191 --> 00:38:55,330
they always look back when Mohammed
created Islam and that was the golden age

698
00:38:55,331 --> 00:38:58,420
and it was where everything was perfect
and stuff like that. And it just,

699
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:00,580
I think that some,
I maybe it's,

700
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:05,020
I think sometimes people will know what
started it. What started the, the most,

701
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,600
the most extreme movement now?
Well,

702
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:12,550
a lot of it came from what they
w hobby sect of Islam, which, uh,

703
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:15,730
was in Saudi Arabia and
continues to be in Saudi Arabia.

704
00:39:15,731 --> 00:39:20,620
It's a puritanical form of Islam.
But, um, this is a long debate.

705
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,530
I don't want to say anything to you but,
but I mean certainly I think one of the,

706
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,070
one of the,

707
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:29,070
one of the things that caused
Islamic fundamentalism was I think,

708
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:33,520
I think Islamic fundamentalism, like
anything else, it's an idea that was,

709
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:38,550
that was born out of a bunch of men who
basically felt lost and insignificant

710
00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:43,240
and needed something to make
themselves feel. Um, uh,

711
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,950
I guess cohesive and important. And you
know, whenever you look back in this,

712
00:39:47,951 --> 00:39:50,140
this is what I was trying to
say about when you look back,

713
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,450
usually when people look
back on the good old days,

714
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:55,600
I think it's a natural reaction.

715
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,480
It's usually because you're connected
to something that's trying to revive

716
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:01,870
something. You're trying to
revive something. And when
you look back at, you know,

717
00:40:01,871 --> 00:40:03,910
whenever you talk about,
well back in the day with Connie,

718
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:07,180
here's with martial arts a lot back in
the day those Kung Fu masters cause walk

719
00:40:07,181 --> 00:40:09,100
on water.
They could fly through the air.

720
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,350
I think it's like kind of like before
things were contaminated that when they

721
00:40:14,351 --> 00:40:19,351
first came out they were
pure and throughout the
ages they become compromised

722
00:40:19,661 --> 00:40:20,800
and contaminated.

723
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,220
That's a human thing we do instead of
realizing the things actually evolve and

724
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:28,450
get better usually, uh, we, we like to
look at like when things first came,

725
00:40:28,451 --> 00:40:29,360
when they were first born,

726
00:40:29,361 --> 00:40:33,100
if there's a purity to it and we got to
get back to that purity because we've

727
00:40:33,101 --> 00:40:37,000
lost our way. And I think
that's why people look back
on history and kind of say,

728
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,980
boy, back in the day when, when,

729
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:43,060
when the mailman came and the Milkman
came and it was just so great and you have

730
00:40:43,061 --> 00:40:46,690
to walk the streets without
anybody killing you are
murdering you and it's all,

731
00:40:46,691 --> 00:40:50,890
it's all a lie. It's all, it's all
horse shit in my opinion. It's all like,

732
00:40:50,891 --> 00:40:54,370
you know, looking back on
the good old days when you
know, things weren't so good,

733
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:57,220
things are actually really
inconvenient and really difficult.

734
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:58,330
You didn't have things like,
you know,

735
00:40:58,331 --> 00:41:01,960
the Internet and access to
information immediately. Sure.

736
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:06,280
It comes with its own problems. But
we live for the most part. Most of us,

737
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,950
even in the past 30 years,
live a much better life.

738
00:41:08,951 --> 00:41:12,310
And I'll give you two examples. I
mean, China and remember China was,

739
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:15,970
was an Russia for that matter.
And most of those countries couldn't,

740
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:17,530
they couldn't leave their own country.

741
00:41:17,531 --> 00:41:21,220
Those were communist countries
with very strong central authority.

742
00:41:21,221 --> 00:41:23,500
Is it controlled everything you did?
Uh,

743
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:27,610
Latin America was all
military dictatorships. Now
they're all democracies.

744
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,480
So I mean, you know, when people look
back on the old days, I'm always like,

745
00:41:31,481 --> 00:41:34,130
I dunno man. You know, you haven't
been studying history too much because

746
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:38,000
it wasn't all the old days can
suck my dick. Correct that correct.

747
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:42,950
Even old cars suck. I like just an
old car when I used to widdle. Yeah.

748
00:41:42,951 --> 00:41:47,510
An old car with a carburetor. It got like
a block, a gallon at always broke down.

749
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,850
They look awesome. They sound stupid.
Right? They just so ridiculously dumb.

750
00:41:52,851 --> 00:41:57,290
The drive, and they were
really, really dangerous. They
didn't have airbags. I mean,

751
00:41:57,291 --> 00:41:58,910
you went through those windshields,
man,

752
00:41:58,911 --> 00:42:02,990
you lost your head and those
breaks were bunks on those breaks.

753
00:42:02,991 --> 00:42:06,140
Barely stopped those cars.
Big stupid drum brakes in the back.

754
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:10,250
We were just driving around in death
machines right now we have abs brakes,

755
00:42:10,251 --> 00:42:11,750
we got computers,
we got everything.

756
00:42:11,751 --> 00:42:15,410
It's amazing that people survived having
those stupid cards didn't most of the

757
00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:19,400
time you had kids riding in the front
seat with those lashed out butterflying hey put

758
00:42:19,401 --> 00:42:22,650
on your lap belt everybody. I'm in the
backseat. I don't need my seat belt.

759
00:42:22,651 --> 00:42:26,780
And you're driving around in this
huge rectangle of metal. Forget it.

760
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:31,340
Barely loosely connected to stupid tires
that are screeching around every corner

761
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,860
and goes my transmission he cars,

762
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:37,730
they would take a turn and you would hear
their tire squeal cause they're barely

763
00:42:37,731 --> 00:42:40,770
hanging onto the road with this shitty
pizza you get in an accident and all you

764
00:42:40,771 --> 00:42:44,360
got to run into is steel and
glass. Not even, not even like,

765
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:45,740
not even that crushed glass.

766
00:42:45,741 --> 00:42:50,720
It's just like that big shards of
glass cars today are the defy physics.

767
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:53,840
You know, don't really, but they
feel like they do Ralph Nader.

768
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:56,960
You can thank him for that. He was the
spearhead for all that. Ralph Nader.

769
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:01,190
That's not do for Shit. How
about that? Ralph Nader was like,

770
00:43:01,191 --> 00:43:03,770
cars are dangerous and I'm going
to do something about it. He,

771
00:43:03,771 --> 00:43:07,250
a lot of people got pissed off by that
guy when he was running for president.

772
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:10,280
I said that's,
that sort of revealed who he really is.

773
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:12,570
Well, yeah, because he
took away, he took votes.

774
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,780
Crucial votes away from
the Democrats though.

775
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,790
Yeah. There was that idea and there was
also the idea that, well, what else?

776
00:43:18,791 --> 00:43:21,090
Who gives a butterfly about politics?
Politics.

777
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:26,500
Motherbutterflyer's saying the Ralph Nader
is the one responsible for it all.

778
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:30,420
Well, Ralph Nader is, Ralph Nader was
the guy who said, you know, these,

779
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:31,290
these cars are,

780
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,360
I think he started a thing called unsafe
at any speed or something. And uh,

781
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,340
I think that's what it was.
I might be wrong, but Ralph
Nader basically said, look,

782
00:43:38,341 --> 00:43:41,820
we've got a lot of people dying needlessly
and it's ridiculous getting paralyzed

783
00:43:41,821 --> 00:43:44,130
and stuff because cars are not safe.
They're dangerous.

784
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:47,550
And there's a way we have the
technology to make cars safer. You know,

785
00:43:47,551 --> 00:43:51,180
letting Mercedes Benz invented the airbag.
Okay.

786
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:53,990
Let told everybody.

787
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:57,990
So, so it's Brody Stevens. Was
He over there? Yes, he was. Yes,

788
00:43:57,991 --> 00:44:01,290
he was late and gentlemen,
Brody Stevens going crazy over there.

789
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,440
Brody Stevens going crazy.
Did he bring his dog?

790
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,490
Uh, he did not bring, the
dog did not bring a stop,

791
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,570
but I was going to say that I want to
buy a Mercedes next because I found that

792
00:44:11,571 --> 00:44:15,650
Mercedes invented the airbag and
gave it to every other car company.

793
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:18,980
They gave it to them because they realized
that was the moral and ethical thing

794
00:44:18,981 --> 00:44:19,640
to do.

795
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,220
So you're going to buy a Mercedes because
of that or because you want to go big

796
00:44:22,221 --> 00:44:23,840
pimpin sons.
I want to go big.

797
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:28,610
Pimpin would you buy like one of those
big sled like Mercedes or would you buy

798
00:44:28,611 --> 00:44:32,250
like the little two door? I want to be, I
don't know, man. That's a good question.

799
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:32,761
Maybe I want to buy.

800
00:44:32,761 --> 00:44:35,550
I should butterflying know what you want to
buy something that drives well you give a

801
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:39,030
butterfly about that or do you
think that when you don't care,

802
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:41,220
how about safety for me now
I want to try it out. Yeah.

803
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:45,630
That's the best safety and
comfort. Yeah. I like an SUV,

804
00:44:45,631 --> 00:44:48,450
so if somebody hits me, I'm not
dying. They want to, I want a horse.

805
00:44:48,451 --> 00:44:52,810
I think horses are sexy.
Talk to me about what I want.

806
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:57,420
Plenty horse store this horses
in my neighborhood near the dam.

807
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:00,600
I'm driving and I swore to God,
I'm not speeding.

808
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:03,330
I am not even remotely spitting.

809
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:07,320
I am a leisurely driving down the street
and there's a lady in front of me with

810
00:45:07,321 --> 00:45:10,850
the horse and a, I'm
nowhere near them. Okay,

811
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:14,640
I'm hundred yards away and
the horse starts freaking,

812
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,530
just does a like a little freak move,

813
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:21,710
like a little freak move and the butterflying
lady with the horse and her friend look

814
00:45:21,991 --> 00:45:24,530
at me and just start doing this thing.

815
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,180
Waking up and down

816
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:32,720
and I swear to you,
making the horse is more of,

817
00:45:32,721 --> 00:45:36,450
you're not even going 25 miles an hour.
I'm not,

818
00:45:36,451 --> 00:45:40,920
I'm not even going so slow.
I'm just relaxing.

819
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:45,480
I'm just driving and this horse just sees
a car coming and it starts bucking and

820
00:45:45,481 --> 00:45:50,481
these gigantic man like arms cause to
everyone and women who are into horses.

821
00:45:50,941 --> 00:45:52,500
They're all the same. First
of all, they're all blonde.

822
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:56,670
They all have cinder block heads and
they all have these squat football player

823
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:59,970
bodies and they're butterflying stupid boots,

824
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,530
funniest leather boots that go up to
their knees to butterfly you shared there

825
00:46:04,531 --> 00:46:08,430
weren't going to like pimps up hoes down.
She was mad at,

826
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:12,690
I swear to God I was nowhere near this
horse. If I had done a douchey thing,

827
00:46:12,691 --> 00:46:16,830
I'm a big fan of animals, but I'd done a
douchey thing. I would, I would admit it.

828
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,580
I put, it was ridiculous. It was
just me driving and all of a sudden

829
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:24,260
fund money.

830
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,170
Funniest horror story I just heard
a couple of days ago, my buddy,

831
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:31,440
what had they found this,
he's fine now,

832
00:46:31,441 --> 00:46:35,100
but they found a benign tumor
growing out of his spinal cord.

833
00:46:35,101 --> 00:46:38,460
He had back problems. She here so he's
like, what's going on? And he's been,

834
00:46:38,461 --> 00:46:41,010
he was a pro athletes up and they
went and they go, dude, you got to,

835
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,380
you got a tumor growing out of your spine.

836
00:46:43,381 --> 00:46:46,800
He has since had it removed and it was a
really successful operation and stopped

837
00:46:46,801 --> 00:46:50,220
by these team of really good time. But
anyway, so he's, he's all bunched up.

838
00:46:50,221 --> 00:46:52,470
He's like a tumor in my day. Like,
yeah, we have to take it out.

839
00:46:52,471 --> 00:46:53,580
It's very delicate procedure.

840
00:46:53,581 --> 00:46:56,260
You could have some paralysis and
he's dealing with all this knee,

841
00:46:56,261 --> 00:46:57,840
doesn't know what to do. He's
like, oh, this is terrible.

842
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:03,110
So he's driving in Marina del Ray and
he's down this alleyway and he's like kind

843
00:47:03,391 --> 00:47:06,240
of in a daze. Like, what am I going
to do? I've got to, this is crazy.

844
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:08,460
Thank God I have health insurance,
but I don't know what I'm going to do.

845
00:47:08,461 --> 00:47:11,760
They've got to cut into my spinal cord
and he's just completely out of it.

846
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:17,340
Out of nowhere, out of nowhere as he's
like contemplating his own mortality,

847
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:22,910
he just sees and these huge eyes
and nostrils and this horse,

848
00:47:24,690 --> 00:47:29,690
this massive horse runs ed his
car and he it on the slant.

849
00:47:30,281 --> 00:47:33,640
He's going really slow anyways
down and now he stops the horse,

850
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,870
jumps over his car,
breaks the windshield,

851
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:42,980
but Denzler does $3,000 worth of
damage on his new car and then run runs

852
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:47,630
over the roof. Good, good,
good, good, good, good. So if
he does, he, he's good. Good,

853
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:48,220
good.

854
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:52,010
She crushed and she'll
run over as bar runs.

855
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,950
It was a police horse
that had gotten spooked.

856
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:58,410
It got spooked by somebody
who threw a firecracker and,

857
00:47:58,411 --> 00:48:01,540
and all of a sudden the horse
ones and he sees like 16

858
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:02,280
cops like,

859
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,060
oh come running around the corner and
now they're running at him and he's like,

860
00:48:05,061 --> 00:48:08,000
what the butterfly is going on? And they
just do see the horse. He goes,

861
00:48:08,001 --> 00:48:11,600
look at my butterflying car. And now he's
like trying to get them to pay for his,

862
00:48:11,601 --> 00:48:12,050
you know,

863
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:16,160
his basically his car is pretty butterflying
crazy that they're were and animals.

864
00:48:16,161 --> 00:48:19,640
Yeah. 2011 it's for
crowd control. Come on.

865
00:48:19,641 --> 00:48:23,720
Why are you riding animals?
Christmases in Lord of the Rings Brahms

866
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,240
everyday because I live in a
question and district and so there's,

867
00:48:26,241 --> 00:48:30,170
this horse is coming over my patio
like scaring my dog all the time.

868
00:48:30,171 --> 00:48:34,270
I mean I live in like horse
world. It's crazy. I didn't get,

869
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,750
how do you get on the mounted police?

870
00:48:35,751 --> 00:48:39,020
Is that a promotion or is that a demotion
that you get made fun of by the other

871
00:48:39,021 --> 00:48:42,670
guys on the motorcycles and
write for dudes? It's really
uncomfortable for girls.

872
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,530
Apparently riding horses
can give you Oregon.

873
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,170
You can blind it upright and
listened. I had, I had sex with this.

874
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:50,010
I had sex with this horse girl

875
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:54,660
in London. Tough Lips. Ah, it was
good in the stable by the way.

876
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:59,060
The smell of horses and leather
and my Dick. Holy Shit, Alexei,

877
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,950
smell that all together.

878
00:49:00,951 --> 00:49:05,250
I smelled the VA should offer a few of
my ticks and I was like, Hey, and saddle,

879
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:09,980
that
ghost is living in my by Brian Calla.

880
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:14,680
It sounds like, uh, sounds like a
butterflying Cologne. I said, dude, 50 cents.

881
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,000
Got a quote and that's what
you need. Horses. Smell that.

882
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:19,330
You smell that Horse Hay and Dick.

883
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:22,170
It's my new Cologne called Horse Hay Day.

884
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:27,830
Hope you don't mind sponsoring.
We spotted the Joe Rogan podcast.

885
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:31,270
Might be the only Cologne I'd be
willing to. Where you want to smile?

886
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,670
You want to smell it?
Horse. He would wear,

887
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:37,640
I would wear that shit and I spell
out there. My natural chimpanzee,

888
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:42,800
I'd Spell Dick was three I's.
Dig with a hyphen.

889
00:49:42,801 --> 00:49:46,970
Then at the end of it probably Jake
gently touch the tip of your penis through

890
00:49:46,971 --> 00:49:49,550
your pants.
Talking about dementia.

891
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,233
That's my favorite,

892
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,730
you know, question district. I live in it.

893
00:49:55,731 --> 00:49:58,940
There's these people that have
those little ponies and it's like,

894
00:49:58,941 --> 00:50:01,960
and I'm just like, who are these people
that buy these minimum opponents?

895
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:06,200
Prance around yet. Yet he's a little
horse. It just walk around with, oh,

896
00:50:06,201 --> 00:50:08,550
they're show ponies.
That's what they're really affectionate.

897
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:13,160
Those little things and there are great,
butterfly, whoa. What? Hey, wait a minute. Hey,

898
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,700
we've been through this before.
Have you ever thought about getting one?

899
00:50:16,701 --> 00:50:19,290
Joe's what I'm asking because I've
loved it. If you had a little show. No,

900
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:21,470
there's a guy across the street
from me that's got a horse stall.

901
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,340
You can get one that's kind of a trip
walk by his house and this is China animal

902
00:50:25,341 --> 00:50:28,020
in his yard. I love the ride.
You ride them. They're just going

903
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,430
to be there,
a pet them and they eat.

904
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:32,300
That's the weirdest thing. They just
wander around. They don't do shit.

905
00:50:32,301 --> 00:50:34,840
If it's like dogs, I
have a yard, dogs are,

906
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:37,760
they're always out there playing and
chasing a squirrel or something and it's

907
00:50:37,761 --> 00:50:40,070
like fill a cart. They're having a good
time out there. But if you have a horse,

908
00:50:40,071 --> 00:50:42,950
they just stand there. It looked
for something neat and just move.

909
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,480
Move a little over here.

910
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:48,480
You could butterfly them, Jo. Brian,
you know you don't butterfly courses.

911
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:52,450
Did you watch the video we played
yesterday? Horses. Fuck you pal. You know,

912
00:50:52,451 --> 00:50:56,370
butterfly them. You are the
conversation killer. My brother.

913
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,010
The mouth can butterfly you dude.
There's some good,

914
00:50:59,370 --> 00:51:01,900
could you imagine sticking your Dick
in a horse? Have you ever felt it?

915
00:51:01,901 --> 00:51:05,070
It's soft as an ass. Does fat
like a baby's butt? Have you ever,

916
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:07,660
it would be perfect. Yeah.
You mean the lips? Yeah,

917
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,150
those turpines says flat grass
stain teeth got ahold of your,

918
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:17,790
snapped it off it like a base.
It likes carrots, tickets,

919
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:21,870
teeth out. Oh, shut the butterfly up bro. I be
great. We could crush you just to bone.

920
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:26,820
Even without teeth out
teeth that would crush you.

921
00:51:26,821 --> 00:51:30,330
It was my mother got bitten by a horse.
Okay. My mother got bit right. Right,

922
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:34,200
right in the shoulder by a horse
and the fun bit and she was like,

923
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:37,520
it was the worst thing she'd ever had.
A what for what reason? Horses by you.

924
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:40,980
If a horse doesn't like you or
horses fearing scared of territorial,

925
00:51:40,981 --> 00:51:45,840
they'll bite you with those horse
teeth and butterfly you up. Correct.

926
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:49,200
Oh, last time I was on a horses because
I got bucked and I haven't been on one

927
00:51:49,201 --> 00:51:51,190
sentence and that was one of
the most scariest things ever.

928
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:54,120
Getting butterflying a horse. It's
freaking out and just bucking you off.

929
00:51:54,121 --> 00:51:57,600
Flying in the CROC or I'm riding
since I grew up riding horses,

930
00:51:57,601 --> 00:51:59,790
I'm still scared of him. Fuck, butterfly.

931
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:03,780
Big giant animals that you ride since
2011 just stupid. I'm just kidding.

932
00:52:03,781 --> 00:52:06,510
I hate horses. That was the best,
the best that my buddy, my buddy Bob,

933
00:52:06,511 --> 00:52:09,300
that that real tough dude. I always tell
you about it. I went to him, I said,

934
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:12,300
he does everything you need rides, bulls
and stuff like that and I've seen him,

935
00:52:12,301 --> 00:52:14,140
I have video of him riding a bull lock,

936
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,190
both knock both his teeth out and
he was like, whatever stayed on it,

937
00:52:17,191 --> 00:52:19,980
stayed on in any way.
Didn't get off. He plays,

938
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:22,990
he plays that poker thing
where you play poker in a bowl.

939
00:52:22,991 --> 00:52:25,710
They let a bull out and the last guy
to get up though, butterfly plays that.

940
00:52:25,711 --> 00:52:28,830
He's always the last guy up. I have
video of that. He's the last guy up.

941
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:30,900
The other guys don't,
everybody's like runs and he's like,

942
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:34,470
he gets up casually like eh, whatever like
that. And I said to him one time, I go,

943
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:39,450
I go, can you a ride a horse? He looked
at me, I guess I'll break a horse bro.

944
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:43,200
I break old. Dead serious.
Like he was insulted.

945
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:46,770
I asked him if he could ride when he
butterflying break a wild horse. I know.

946
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:49,590
How would you do that? He goes, I butterflying
ride it until it butterflying listens to me.

947
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:53,400
That's how I get, that's how I do that.
I was like, you're a butterflying bad ass

948
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,720
work. Well, the horse just
gives up and becomes your,

949
00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:00,890
now you have to break that. You break a
horse on a line, you, you, you have it.

950
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,860
You teach it at a run in a circle and you,
you have it on a line.

951
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:07,680
So if they get a wild horse, they really
can break a wild horse. If someone can,

952
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:09,470
you could lasso a wild.

953
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:12,580
Yeah, but there's a technique to it. You
have to unity have you don't get on it.

954
00:53:12,581 --> 00:53:15,890
At first you, you tether
it, you tether it to a,

955
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:18,770
like a mine and you and you
and you teach it how to run.

956
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:22,520
How does it not just stomp the butterfly out
of you? It does. A lot of times they will,

957
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:25,390
but you got to, you have a whip
and you keep them in. I mean,

958
00:53:25,391 --> 00:53:27,840
it's somebody who really knows what
they're doing. You got to whip it.

959
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,830
Did people still do that in this day and
age? You still try to tame wild horses?

960
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:34,560
Well, you have to break a horse.
Wears a wild horse these days.

961
00:53:34,561 --> 00:53:35,370
Where are you finding no,

962
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:39,350
I wouldn't find packs of wild horses
and hang out with the trip courses are

963
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:43,800
indigenous, I believe originally
in the Gobi desert of um,

964
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:48,790
of Nepal. I mean, I'm of a, of Mongolia.
So that's where horses, yeah, that would,

965
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,240
that's where the wild asses came from
and all that. So I believe that the,

966
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:56,450
the original, the original horse, um,
that's where they were originally, uh,

967
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,330
from the steps of Asia. So did they come
over here on boats? They came over here.

968
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:04,720
They think when the, I
need to know Zach. Zach,

969
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,750
in fact,
um,

970
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:09,570
the native Americans didn't ride
horses from what I understand at first,

971
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:14,440
those were brought over by Spaniards,
by the Spaniards. And so, um,

972
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:15,840
well that's how the
whole deal with the ink,

973
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,320
the ink is thought they were gods
because they were riding horses.

974
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:23,580
They were pretty amazing.
Where God's like, they had
no idea what the butterfly was up.

975
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,850
You imagine you see somebody riding a
huge horse, an animal you'd never seen.

976
00:54:26,851 --> 00:54:29,400
He'd be like, what the butterfly is that?
That's why I always try. When I ride,

977
00:54:29,401 --> 00:54:33,000
I was riding naked just so that they,
so I looked like a Centaur.

978
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:36,390
You do look like a sentence. Yeah.
I never know where to put my balls.

979
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:40,740
I just rested on its butterflying backbone when
I need side first guy to ride a horse.

980
00:54:40,741 --> 00:54:44,490
Must have been a bad mother butterflyer. That's
what I mean. How about the first guy?

981
00:54:44,491 --> 00:54:45,301
I decided,
you know what?

982
00:54:45,301 --> 00:54:49,630
I'm going to write a butterflying book dares
mates who dares me throw eight. No,

983
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,630
let's go further.
Throw a testicle,

984
00:54:51,631 --> 00:54:55,230
cinch on that butterflying bull and tie my
risk to it and I'm going to butterflying see

985
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:58,440
how long I can stay on it.
They tie.

986
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:00,450
You got to tie your risks
of that butterflying thing.

987
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:04,000
That's why when they fall off and they
get caught and they're being flopped

988
00:55:04,001 --> 00:55:07,150
around like a ragdoll and stomp.
Yeah. Have you ever seen him get stock

989
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:12,150
guys die that way? No. Why didn't
you have to tie yourself on?

990
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:14,400
Why do you have to find,
can you just hold on?

991
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:17,610
I don't know what a piece of it like
part of the macho thing you got to tell

992
00:55:17,611 --> 00:55:20,880
yourself mom, cause that's how you
stay on the bull on. You can't hold on.

993
00:55:20,881 --> 00:55:23,280
You know when it's moving like
that buddy of mine, listen to this.

994
00:55:23,281 --> 00:55:26,780
You want to hear some crazy shit.
I forget what branch of,

995
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:30,300
whether it's a rangers or what
branch of the special certain forces,

996
00:55:30,301 --> 00:55:31,134
whatever you have to do.

997
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:35,760
He was talking about when he bailed out
of the system and this was what they

998
00:55:35,761 --> 00:55:39,660
were going to have these guys do,
they were going to tie them together.

999
00:55:39,661 --> 00:55:42,960
They hog tie them and throw them in the
water and then you die and then bring

1000
00:55:42,961 --> 00:55:43,970
you back and they bring you back.

1001
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:47,100
The navy seals that that's
what the seal teams doing what?

1002
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,630
That's his butterfly dude.

1003
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:54,710
They want you to be willing to drown and
be convinced that your boys are going

1004
00:55:54,811 --> 00:55:57,870
to go in there and dive in.
Once the bubbles stop by the way,

1005
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:02,430
okay and no sooner the bubbles
stop. You go in, pull the guy out.

1006
00:56:02,431 --> 00:56:03,540
He's drowned.

1007
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:07,080
You've pumped them out and rescue him
and give him CPR and bring them back to

1008
00:56:07,081 --> 00:56:09,300
life. They did the seal team, seal teams,

1009
00:56:09,301 --> 00:56:13,740
the seal team six apparently to wrap
your brain around that, but dude,

1010
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:18,570
and that was it for him.
This is where I'm drawing the line.

1011
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:22,210
I did not know you guys were going to
go here and I've never known that there

1012
00:56:22,211 --> 00:56:24,160
was, we were doing today. No bench press.

1013
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:27,700
No running. You're going to die and
we're going to bring you back. Trust me.

1014
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:31,840
Fuck Outta here. Fuck. I'll wake up
with you making out. Nah. Oh my God.

1015
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:35,110
Could you imagine what must be
going through your head who,

1016
00:56:35,111 --> 00:56:39,370
we'll just dive in there. Hogtied
and drown. It's always that way.

1017
00:56:39,371 --> 00:56:41,740
It's back in the, I remember back in
the day they'd send you out with a,

1018
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:45,760
with a line in the Masai Mara, the Masa
and in Kenya and the bound to they,

1019
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:48,400
they'd send you out with a spear and
go, Hey, guess what you're doing.

1020
00:56:48,460 --> 00:56:51,070
You want to be a man?
Go kill a butterflying line with a spear.

1021
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:55,060
And they said the real men would get the
line to charge him and is in line with

1022
00:56:55,061 --> 00:56:58,840
charge and jump. You let it
fall on the spear. Uh, yeah.

1023
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:03,060
Jesus Christ or what if
you miss your butterflying dad.

1024
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:07,960
I was at the MGM and it was last weekend
for the UFC and they have lions in the

1025
00:57:07,961 --> 00:57:09,400
middle of the casino.
Dude,

1026
00:57:09,401 --> 00:57:14,401
there's this big glass room and
there's this gigantic apex Predator.

1027
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:18,700
It's and it's got a wall and it's whacking
the ball around and little kids are

1028
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:22,810
sitting there staring at it, going
look and pointing did what I was doing.

1029
00:57:22,811 --> 00:57:26,650
I remember I was doing mad TV and I was
on the set and they brought a 525 pound

1030
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:30,850
male lions on a chain and
if it was the lion they had,

1031
00:57:30,851 --> 00:57:32,850
they had done the drawing of line,

1032
00:57:32,851 --> 00:57:37,030
came over and they were wondering
why I wouldn't go near it.

1033
00:57:37,031 --> 00:57:40,000
I was up on the landing and they're
like, dude, it's tame. I was like,

1034
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:41,020
butterflying shut up.

1035
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:47,020
DNA kicks in and it looks at me like I'm
a gazelle. We're not a butterflying thing.

1036
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:51,360
It's team. What does that mean?
It's 525 pounds to kitty cat.

1037
00:57:51,361 --> 00:57:55,080
It's still got its instincts full
intact and your hold your food.

1038
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:59,660
It's one, maybe two generations
removed from the butterflying job,

1039
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:02,140
man. What are you going to do?
Make yourself hard to swallow?

1040
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:06,070
Now you sure that he's absolutely
exercise to the fullest so that he's not a

1041
00:58:06,071 --> 00:58:09,880
little uptight and tense. Right? Right.
Maybe he's having a bad traveling.

1042
00:58:09,881 --> 00:58:12,640
Might be freaking him out. That's
like elephants. That's like elephants.

1043
00:58:12,641 --> 00:58:17,410
Elephants kill their handlers, their
mock boots all the time. Elephants,

1044
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:20,230
it's really interesting when you like,
cause when you're,

1045
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:21,730
when you talk about breaking an animal,

1046
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:23,770
they have to break an
elephant and it's awful.

1047
00:58:23,771 --> 00:58:27,880
They tie a a small elephant to like
steaks and they basically beat it.

1048
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,080
I saw this thing, this
a documentary. They,

1049
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:34,540
they'll break an elephant spirit problem
is that now you're riding your elephant

1050
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:35,680
and the Ma,
it's in India.

1051
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,170
It's like kind of a religious
thing and I think in Thailand they,

1052
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:42,310
they will bathe it. They live with it.
They spend all their time, they feed it,

1053
00:58:42,311 --> 00:58:44,920
they bay that they clean it, and they
get very attached to their elephants.

1054
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,640
That an elephant one day just decides,
you know what?

1055
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:50,890
This is ridiculous.

1056
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:55,030
You are a parasite on my back and I
don't butterflying feel like doing what you're

1057
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,070
doing. So I'm going to
have, and they rage,

1058
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,910
they'll go off and erase race and
when they get their handler, they,

1059
00:59:00,911 --> 00:59:02,800
a lot of times we'll just keep,
they'll,

1060
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:07,180
they'll stomp them till he's jelly and
pull them apart with their tosca holding

1061
00:59:07,181 --> 00:59:11,650
arms off and shit. And you're not doing
a goddamn thing until he's done. Wow.

1062
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:14,650
Making mincemeat for real out of you.
You know?

1063
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:19,570
That's why no chimps, no
butterflying elephants. That's
the theme of this podcast.

1064
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:22,180
Help me if a dog's

1065
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:25,100
target humans in some
parts of the world too,

1066
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:28,520
especially if they've lost
loved ones to come through,

1067
00:59:28,521 --> 00:59:31,970
they come through villages.
If they've lost loved ones to poachers,

1068
00:59:31,971 --> 00:59:35,360
they develop an attitude
and they developed a hatred
for humans and then they go

1069
00:59:35,361 --> 00:59:37,490
and attack and smash people's houses,

1070
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:41,240
just smashed their houses and pull them
out. They're so big. And so powerful.

1071
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:44,810
Your House is nothing. They just walk
right through your house. I mean,

1072
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:48,770
literally just kicked down your front
door. Popey blowout, stabbed him to death.

1073
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:53,600
It's crazy. They don't give a butterfly. No,
it's an algorithm. It's just so strange.

1074
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:58,610
Even you think about Africa and the
quantity of gigantic things that can kill

1075
00:59:58,611 --> 01:00:01,260
you there. India too. You know, back
in the day, a lot of people tied.

1076
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:03,040
There's the cobras.

1077
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,800
A lot of people die that
way in the rural areas.

1078
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:10,040
It's amazing when you look in Africa,
I mean it's one of the reasons why,

1079
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:13,670
you know, like African culture, you know,
if you look at the rest of the world,

1080
01:00:13,671 --> 01:00:16,100
like all the inventions that have
come out, all these different places,

1081
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:18,020
the most dangerous countries,
Africa,

1082
01:00:18,021 --> 01:00:20,280
and that's the place where like the
least amount of inventions, right?

1083
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,290
It's like you don't have
time. No. You know, if you're,
if you're living in Africa,

1084
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:27,080
you're actually growing up and
developing in Africa. You got butterflyed man.

1085
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:28,730
You got dropped off in some place.

1086
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,270
You're born in an area that's
filled with monsters. Aren't they?

1087
01:00:32,271 --> 01:00:36,860
More advanced and other monsters like
Kipling's woodworking and stuff like that.

1088
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,230
I mean,
living their lives.

1089
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:42,650
There was an awesome documentary
on the Congo and these, uh,

1090
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:44,660
talked about these fishermen that,
that uh,

1091
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,550
the literally from the
time that they're young,

1092
01:00:46,551 --> 01:00:50,130
they hang off trees and is it
a raging river underneath them?

1093
01:00:50,131 --> 01:00:53,000
And they've developed this
intricate system of, uh,

1094
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,610
of nets that they create themselves.

1095
01:00:55,790 --> 01:01:00,350
They make their own rope using twine from
trees and shit like that. And they're,

1096
01:01:00,351 --> 01:01:03,650
they're hanging from these butterflying trees
over this raging river and it looks

1097
01:01:03,651 --> 01:01:06,860
like if they fall in their butterflyed, if the
very least you're going to get smashed,

1098
01:01:06,861 --> 01:01:08,030
you may very well drown.
I mean,

1099
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:11,300
this is like some serious rapids and
they're scooping fish up as they do it in

1100
01:01:11,301 --> 01:01:14,240
the handing the nets up and
it's really butterflying complex.

1101
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,740
And if you look at it
and said, well, you know,

1102
01:01:15,741 --> 01:01:18,830
they're very sophisticated for living
in this environment because if it was me

1103
01:01:18,831 --> 01:01:21,920
in that environment, how the butterfly am I
going to get a fish and this raging crazy?

1104
01:01:21,921 --> 01:01:23,180
See,
I'm not going to figure that shit out.

1105
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:25,180
But it lived at the Masa in Africa.

1106
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:28,630
And he told me that these dudes can tell
you the difference between like a blade

1107
01:01:28,631 --> 01:01:29,750
of grass and,

1108
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:33,490
and what it means and what kind of animal
pass through and why that animal chose

1109
01:01:33,491 --> 01:01:36,100
that play of grass to eat.
And he said they're there.

1110
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:39,310
They have an encyclopedic
knowledge of their environment.

1111
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:42,990
And it's like anything else. Human beings
adapt and, and you know, they use their,

1112
01:01:42,991 --> 01:01:47,800
their minds for what is relevant to
their survival and their, their, um,

1113
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,180
their flourishing.
They're probably,

1114
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:53,170
it's a trippy thing. These are
tribal guys that a higher, uh, well,

1115
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:57,550
Americans rather hired them to go and hunt
and they, uh, they take him to Africa.

1116
01:01:57,551 --> 01:02:00,080
Like there's, you know, there's
certain guy, game hunters yeah.

1117
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:05,500
That want one of everything. They're like,
Ooh, last time I got a zebra, you know,

1118
01:02:05,501 --> 01:02:07,390
like they're shooting zebra.
She just stood that,

1119
01:02:07,391 --> 01:02:10,750
I never want to say that trophy hunting.
It's a strange to me. Very weird. Yeah.

1120
01:02:10,751 --> 01:02:13,030
I don't, I on one hand, you know,

1121
01:02:13,031 --> 01:02:16,940
it can be argued that hunting
actually pays to, uh, when,

1122
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:20,040
when you pay for a hunting tags,
it pays to keep everything

1123
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,230
healthy. Yeah. Because,
because if you manage the
environment, you put, if you put,

1124
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:27,390
if there's a, if there's a profit
in your environment, so if you,

1125
01:02:27,391 --> 01:02:31,110
if you're making money off of,
off of hunting,

1126
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:34,100
it's in everybody's interest
to preserve that. The,

1127
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,000
you don't want to kill the
goose with the Golden Egg.

1128
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:37,560
You want to keep the goose alive.

1129
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:40,370
It goes towards money goes towards
management and conservation.

1130
01:02:40,371 --> 01:02:42,830
And that's a really tricky thing when
it comes to hunting. Even in America,

1131
01:02:42,831 --> 01:02:43,550
like I've had,

1132
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:47,540
I've talked to so many people but hunting
and they have this crazy butterflying like

1133
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:51,050
almost, you know, Disney
movie view of, of what,

1134
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:54,770
what me eating meat is and what, you know,
meet where meat comes from. You know,

1135
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,200
like, man, you don't want to do that.
You don't want to take some deer's life.

1136
01:02:57,201 --> 01:03:00,140
You want to do that. Like, do
you want understand leather
shoes? But first of all,

1137
01:03:00,141 --> 01:03:01,700
do you not understand that you have to,

1138
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:05,780
do you understand that unless you want
a nation filled with mountain lions,

1139
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,790
right? You have to kill the deer. Okay?

1140
01:03:07,791 --> 01:03:09,320
Cause otherwise you're
going to have no predators.

1141
01:03:09,321 --> 01:03:12,260
And then they're going to be sick. They're
going to starve to death everywhere.

1142
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:15,260
They're going to be hitting
them with cars. They're gonna
die, miserable, horrible,

1143
01:03:15,261 --> 01:03:17,930
vicious deaths. You got to
call her. Yeah, you have to,

1144
01:03:17,931 --> 01:03:20,450
because otherwise they'll just,
I mean, it's a natural balance.

1145
01:03:20,451 --> 01:03:22,880
And in the way we've set up civilization,

1146
01:03:22,881 --> 01:03:24,980
we're not allowing any
predators around us, you know,

1147
01:03:24,981 --> 01:03:28,010
which is a pretty smart thing, right? So
because of that, you know, if you're not,

1148
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:29,810
you've done a predators and
you have all these deer,

1149
01:03:29,811 --> 01:03:33,350
you have to butterflying shoot some of
ours. You've got to manage it. People,

1150
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:37,250
they don't want me to mention the venison
is good. It's delicious, it's delicious.

1151
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,270
Did the crazy idea that you're
not supposed to do that.

1152
01:03:39,271 --> 01:03:41,870
[inaudible] it's such a strange argument,
you know,

1153
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:45,110
are these these butterflying deer gonna
live forever and cure cancer?

1154
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:48,020
Like what are you talking about? Stupid.
You're going to die eventually anyway,

1155
01:03:48,050 --> 01:03:52,860
by the way, let's be honest. Their food, I
mean kind of the food. Yeah. Food shipped.

1156
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:56,480
Beautiful. Yes, they are definitely
beautiful. I'm not saying eat all of them,

1157
01:03:57,050 --> 01:03:58,880
but you should shoot a few every year

1158
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:00,840
there's a reason they're animals.

1159
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:05,130
They're animals of of flight
because predators like a
minimalist look. Delicious.

1160
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:08,670
Yeah. Did you punch a deer if it
wasn't an attack, you back, dude,

1161
01:04:08,671 --> 01:04:11,880
these are dangerous. Deers. Fuck
human talk. You back. Would you?

1162
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:16,140
Why would I do that? I don't know why.
Don't want to hit it. I've had it.

1163
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,960
You would have had if you had a
pet deer that would get you laid.

1164
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:22,490
How you guys close? Want to pet my deer?
Every single girl in the world like

1165
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:30,300
tamed it. Do you have a way with animals?
Do you remember that movie? Beastmaster?

1166
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:30,900
Yes,
I do.

1167
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:35,670
With dude who was like sculpted abs
and no shirts and he's just ready.

1168
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:39,810
He's just in tune with all the animals of
all time. Ran a show of all time there.

1169
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:40,693
I said

1170
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:47,280
I butterflying lived the beastmaster.
What was his deal?

1171
01:04:47,281 --> 01:04:51,840
How was he selling tool with the animals
blow. I butterflying, I took his class.

1172
01:04:51,841 --> 01:04:53,460
I'll tell you,
we don't have time right now.

1173
01:04:53,461 --> 01:04:57,370
I took his workshop doctor due to what
workshop hit the beastmaster work.

1174
01:04:57,371 --> 01:05:01,290
She had a workshop. No doctor Doolittle.
You had me really excited. I was like,

1175
01:05:01,291 --> 01:05:03,510
I've got to go to this
workshop based mastery.

1176
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:07,890
Well I had those two goddamn parents so
that was pretty much and two dogs and a

1177
01:05:07,891 --> 01:05:12,630
snake. What an asshole. I was. You've had
a bunch of crazy and my thirties I did

1178
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:18,460
well. You know what man, if I could
have a children look a gigantic reserve,

1179
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:21,610
how can my backyard, I know we've
talked about that before. A building,

1180
01:05:21,611 --> 01:05:25,660
some very thick wall managing it like
a zoo environment just to have a huge

1181
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:28,180
chimpanzee I closed.
That's going to protect me.

1182
01:05:28,181 --> 01:05:30,940
Like I just want something on my next
to me all the time that just might,

1183
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:35,200
you know, turn that may have
hard times. How would, how would,

1184
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:39,110
how would a GSP do against
the chimp if you muzzle,

1185
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:42,890
if you muscle that he couldn't bite you
with those butterflying, those mouth tasks.

1186
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:47,050
Crush it. It would crush your bones.
They're talking to, dude, I was, I was in,

1187
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:50,800
I was in the San Diego Zoo and I was
watching the mountain gorillas wrestle.

1188
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:53,900
They're the best wrestlers on the plant.
Strong,

1189
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:58,240
but they're also wrestlers that they
grow up wrestling did the babies,

1190
01:05:58,450 --> 01:06:02,460
all they do is wrestle all day and
they do good moves like Granby roles.

1191
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:07,420
Real drags, real real is to
arm, arm drags, Granby roles.

1192
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:11,680
I mean guillotines it's amazing. It's
incredible. Wow. I was literally,

1193
01:06:11,681 --> 01:06:15,070
I'm telling you I'm not kidding when I
say it, like ankle picks. Crazy shit.

1194
01:06:15,071 --> 01:06:19,380
Feigns docs. It's at the San
Diego Zoo. Go there, there, there,

1195
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:23,080
and you can go right up still to the
glass and then there's the silver back.

1196
01:06:23,081 --> 01:06:27,010
Could just sits with his back to everybody
and you just look at this. 600 pounds,

1197
01:06:27,011 --> 01:06:31,180
six foot one gorilla, six
one 600 pounds. No Fat,

1198
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:35,890
ladies and gentlemen. No fat
on it. He 600 pounds. Six one.

1199
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:39,770
That's two of Brock Lesnar's.
Okay. I would love to watch them.

1200
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:43,440
All he needs is Broccoli.
That's all he eats is butterflying grass.

1201
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:47,860
Grass and bamboo sheets and shins.
Isn't that incredible, that,

1202
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:51,820
that big and that strong and it's mostly
to keep everybody the butterfly away. Yeah.

1203
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,050
Just let me butterflying eat.

1204
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:57,070
Oh just let me sit here and
have some butterflying vegetables.

1205
01:06:57,071 --> 01:06:59,920
They were trying to figure out how strong
a mountain gorillas and they couldn't

1206
01:06:59,921 --> 01:07:00,754
figure it out,

1207
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:04,540
but there was this log that took
like seven men to move cause they,

1208
01:07:04,541 --> 01:07:07,670
it was part of the exhibit
and the mountain gorilla
had a little tantrum and it

1209
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:12,510
flung the log. It flung, it didn't
just throw it but full, you know,

1210
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:15,010
when you fling something
it means it's really light.

1211
01:07:15,011 --> 01:07:17,560
Like don't fling that bottle at me.

1212
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:21,130
It really is a trip that they're so
strong and all they do is eat vegetables.

1213
01:07:21,310 --> 01:07:25,330
Like what happened to the gorilla that
made it not want to just pick some animal

1214
01:07:25,331 --> 01:07:27,020
up and start eating at one day?
I don't know.

1215
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,730
It's a weird to cause they're just
total her before is, you know. Yeah,

1216
01:07:30,731 --> 01:07:33,730
pretty much right there. I don't
think they eat any meat. Chimps,

1217
01:07:33,731 --> 01:07:37,300
chimps eat a lot of it. A lot of meat
chance organized hunting parties. Yeah.

1218
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:40,240
I think we've talked about this
before on the show. You and I have,

1219
01:07:40,700 --> 01:07:41,531
I'm not sure if we have,

1220
01:07:41,531 --> 01:07:44,600
because it's a subject I can just don't
ever get tired of that so I never do.

1221
01:07:44,860 --> 01:07:46,400
I can't, I can go on
forever. Talking about,

1222
01:07:46,401 --> 01:07:48,820
Chad was talking about butterflying
hunting chimps all day.

1223
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:52,280
Did I tell you went to a fake Fogo de
Chao the other day? A fake, a fake one.

1224
01:07:52,281 --> 01:07:56,840
It's called like Samba at universal
and forget a child if you've been there

1225
01:07:56,841 --> 01:07:58,310
where it's like all you can eat meat,

1226
01:07:58,311 --> 01:08:01,640
like there's come and
bring shit to Haas Korea.

1227
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:07,070
So I sat there for half hour and the
only thing I got was a guy with a sausage

1228
01:08:07,071 --> 01:08:07,610
come over.

1229
01:08:07,610 --> 01:08:10,880
So I'm like getting kind of pissed and
I've told this the waitress like four

1230
01:08:10,881 --> 01:08:13,560
times. Like all right, I went to
Bacone, I want some kind of meat.

1231
01:08:13,561 --> 01:08:15,290
Have been here for 30
minutes. Right, right.

1232
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,460
So then they get one come over with one
piece of meat and slice it off and send

1233
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:19,520
it goes boom,
boom.

1234
01:08:19,521 --> 01:08:24,080
And all these dancers come out like these
Brazilian dancers and all them people

1235
01:08:24,081 --> 01:08:27,620
run away and you're just sitting there
watching this show for like 10 minutes

1236
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:32,030
and then you come back and then it was,
it was the most like obvious,

1237
01:08:32,031 --> 01:08:35,270
like we only want you to eat a teeny
piece of meat and then we're going to go

1238
01:08:35,271 --> 01:08:38,600
over here and really like
I love,

1239
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:41,020
I love a little dancing
with my meat better.

1240
01:08:41,770 --> 01:08:44,350
I was at a restaurant once when
they started doing that and I just,

1241
01:08:44,351 --> 01:08:48,010
I just was like, no, I don't want to
to pull me out of my chair. I'm like,

1242
01:08:48,011 --> 01:08:48,790
no thank you.

1243
01:08:48,790 --> 01:08:53,190
I'll take dancers any day over the
accordion and the guitar and that, that,

1244
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:54,033
that sing.

1245
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:58,080
Oh, it's going to let you know
when you're walking in the door.

1246
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:05,040
I was in the Dominican Republic
with my family, by the way,

1247
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:07,960
family vacations or the worst,
but anyway. Yeah, but I was

1248
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:11,980
way rather have someone played music than
someone tried to pull you out of your

1249
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:12,814
chair

1250
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:16,990
dance. That's what this chick was
doing. Just like, come on. It was just,

1251
01:09:17,170 --> 01:09:19,570
it was just trying to step
up and down trying to,

1252
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:23,950
it was just trying to confuse you so
you don't realize that you're not eating

1253
01:09:23,951 --> 01:09:28,840
meat. Say that you would get stuff and
then you get this headache stuffed because

1254
01:09:28,841 --> 01:09:30,690
there you're eating salad bars.
Okay.

1255
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:35,470
I want you to notice to check 30
minutes once a month. I really love,

1256
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:40,270
I just like Brazilian. Why don't you come
down for the UFC? UFC isn't August. Um,

1257
01:09:40,730 --> 01:09:44,380
I've seen him there. Okay. We're going.
Really? Yeah, we're going to Brazil. I'm,

1258
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:49,120
I'm in there saying that now.
It's a,

1259
01:09:49,121 --> 01:09:51,440
yeah. I don't think the
card has been put in place.

1260
01:09:51,441 --> 01:09:53,960
Check through it cause it's quite
a ways away. It's an August.

1261
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:56,110
I'm off to figure out who they're
going to fall over. Leave.

1262
01:09:56,450 --> 01:10:00,270
I'm pretty sure it's locked in. It's
coffee. Better in Brazil. Coffee. Yeah.

1263
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:04,320
Brazil stone. Really known
for their coffee. No, no, no.

1264
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:07,850
I always thought so because Columbia,
Hawaii,

1265
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:12,470
Hawaii is the best coffee
resilience with big asses. Yes.

1266
01:10:12,471 --> 01:10:13,640
And toxo plasma.

1267
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:18,110
That's the place where people were
infected by that cap of 66% of the people.

1268
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:21,000
What you don't know about
this. Oh my brother. Got It.

1269
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:22,820
You talked about it
yesterday unfortunately,

1270
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,450
but I've been bringing up again because
you're going to freak the butterfly out.

1271
01:10:25,450 --> 01:10:26,870
I noted there is a,

1272
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:32,170
there is a parasite called toxo plasma
and it's a cat parasite and it infects

1273
01:10:32,721 --> 01:10:33,350
rats.

1274
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:37,700
And what it does to rats is it gets the
rats and rewires their sexual system and

1275
01:10:37,701 --> 01:10:40,250
has them attracted to
the smell of cat piss.

1276
01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:45,620
So these rats start going weird cat piss
is and like literally a testy swelled a

1277
01:10:45,621 --> 01:10:46,320
whole deal.

1278
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:50,210
The cats eat them and now the cat has
this parasite and that's how it travels

1279
01:10:50,211 --> 01:10:53,000
from cat to rat. And it gets to
humans and it gets to humans.

1280
01:10:53,001 --> 01:10:56,810
If they touch cat shit or they touch it
when it's in the field and when it gets

1281
01:10:56,811 --> 01:10:58,520
in your system,
it does two things for women.

1282
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:02,540
It makes them more sexually promiscuous
and it makes it more submissive.

1283
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:05,030
And for men it makes it
more arrogant assholes.

1284
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:08,870
And they even have correlated
it to successful soccer teams.

1285
01:11:09,030 --> 01:11:12,320
When you have the countries cause it
makes you so aggressive and so reckless.

1286
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:14,640
And you look at countries
that are successful

1287
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:18,960
in the World Cup also have very high
rates of Toxoplasma and their population.

1288
01:11:18,961 --> 01:11:19,930
I need to get some time.

1289
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:24,040
Want to know you don't want it because
it slows your reaction time to either was

1290
01:11:24,041 --> 01:11:28,140
a doctor on, on, um, uh, there's a youtube
video. I really forget the guy's name.

1291
01:11:28,141 --> 01:11:29,280
I'll have to go over it again.

1292
01:11:29,281 --> 01:11:31,960
But it was a guy who was a
toxoplasma researcher who, uh,

1293
01:11:31,961 --> 01:11:36,480
used to work in the emergency room and
he found that when they tested people who

1294
01:11:36,481 --> 01:11:38,010
were motorcycle accident victims,

1295
01:11:38,190 --> 01:11:41,560
a disproportionate amount of them
were toxoplasma infecting wow.

1296
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:42,720
And it made him reckless.

1297
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,050
It makes you reckless and it may even
saw your reaction time. That's crazy.

1298
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:48,090
It's really strange. But
it's a, it's a, you know,

1299
01:11:48,091 --> 01:11:52,350
it's a real brain altering parasite
that's affected 50 million Americans.

1300
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:53,490
I just want to see what,

1301
01:11:53,491 --> 01:11:56,970
in 30 years when we've really kind of
got a lot of this biochemical chemistry

1302
01:11:56,971 --> 01:12:00,330
down and how our body's reacting kind
of pills they're going to come up with.

1303
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:03,780
Are they going to be able to eradicate
something like this so you can figure out

1304
01:12:03,781 --> 01:12:06,580
a way to send nanobots in
there to kill all the question,

1305
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:08,130
what the butterfly would they do?

1306
01:12:08,131 --> 01:12:11,880
How would you kill something that becomes
a brain parasite whenever people ask

1307
01:12:11,881 --> 01:12:13,620
these questions, you know what I'm
saying to myself? People say, well,

1308
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:15,270
you know we're going to and we're
going to come up with different things,

1309
01:12:15,271 --> 01:12:17,910
but there's always going to be playing
all death and there's always going to be

1310
01:12:17,911 --> 01:12:21,270
these issues and new diseases
and new mutations and stuff.

1311
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,970
Nobody's time is finite.
You just have to accept that.

1312
01:12:23,971 --> 01:12:27,330
I mean make use of it what you can
and keep it as healthy as possible,

1313
01:12:27,331 --> 01:12:30,630
but you must accept that it's fine. I know
I'm always working out though. My, my,

1314
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:33,120
my buddy who's a writer and
doesn't do a lot of stuff,

1315
01:12:33,121 --> 01:12:36,090
but he's a kind of intellectual guy
and he's always looking at me and I'm

1316
01:12:36,091 --> 01:12:36,924
working out and I'm trying,

1317
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:39,150
I'm doing my dead list and I'm
doing all this stuff and he's like,

1318
01:12:39,151 --> 01:12:43,860
look at the little man trying to stop
the clock trying to slow the clock tab.

1319
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:48,180
Right. That's true. But you know what
man, it does one thing for me for sure.

1320
01:12:48,390 --> 01:12:52,050
It makes me like a blow stress
out and makes me see the world.

1321
01:12:52,051 --> 01:12:54,780
It makes me feel better.
I loud, I didn't exercise.

1322
01:12:54,781 --> 01:12:57,720
I know everybody thinks it's a vanity
thing and a lot of it is vanity. You know,

1323
01:12:57,721 --> 01:12:59,790
there's a lot of guys what you know,
you want to look good,

1324
01:12:59,791 --> 01:13:00,990
you want to look better,
you don't want to,

1325
01:13:00,991 --> 01:13:03,630
you don't want to be sexually
sexually discussed. Wow.

1326
01:13:03,631 --> 01:13:07,860
So talk about like in it part of my
standup now I'm just talking about how I

1327
01:13:07,861 --> 01:13:10,200
really also think it's,
it's genetic.

1328
01:13:10,201 --> 01:13:12,450
It's also like you want
to do a couple of things.

1329
01:13:12,451 --> 01:13:15,450
One you want to look like you got
to, you know, guys, bench press.

1330
01:13:15,451 --> 01:13:18,090
There's no reason to really deep bench.
Isn't that kind of a useless exercise?

1331
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:20,850
You never really do the best
of scapes. Yeah, yeah it is.

1332
01:13:20,851 --> 01:13:23,850
But I'm just saying that usually you're
not in a situation where you have to hip

1333
01:13:23,851 --> 01:13:27,000
escape and I'm mad, but I'm going to
hip escape but at least three days.

1334
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:30,660
But it's good.
But it's just a breeding instinct.

1335
01:13:30,661 --> 01:13:32,300
We want to fluff our
feathers so girls know,

1336
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:35,400
see that we've got that going and we
want to look like we can fight the tiger

1337
01:13:35,401 --> 01:13:38,940
man want to look like we're, we're,
we're, you know, that's why guys butterflying,

1338
01:13:38,941 --> 01:13:40,230
you know,
you've got to look like you.

1339
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:44,010
You're the bench is not really that
important, but it flawless. You know,

1340
01:13:44,011 --> 01:13:46,560
it's like your peacock here.
It's like, it's like birds, man.

1341
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:50,520
She's really funny when you see some
dudes look completely disproportionate.

1342
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:54,110
These weird bodies with chicks,
strippers, like a big chest.

1343
01:13:54,111 --> 01:13:57,330
I read it and Muslims fit this bro.
There was this one dude at the gym.

1344
01:13:57,540 --> 01:14:00,840
He had this giant chest and giant arms.
Okay.

1345
01:14:00,990 --> 01:14:03,990
And then he used to wear sweatpants.
Okay. You never saw his legs,

1346
01:14:03,991 --> 01:14:06,390
but there's no way they could match his
upper bodies I'm provided was massive

1347
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:10,020
and his neck was like a small man's are.

1348
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:14,570
That's a terrible thing goes this man
woe, woe. Always got to look at the neck.

1349
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:17,420
You've got to look at the neck and the
legs. Actually first, crazy wobbly.

1350
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:21,040
I was like, this is the weirdest
combination of I like this guy.

1351
01:14:21,370 --> 01:14:24,890
Just decided to just everyday do
the same goddamn exercises. Yeah,

1352
01:14:24,910 --> 01:14:28,210
flies just packed.
Deck blew up his body,

1353
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:31,660
but there's probably a complete
disconnect between all three systems.

1354
01:14:31,661 --> 01:14:35,620
I bet his body works terrible.
It's probably so confused
as to why it's so heavy.

1355
01:14:35,621 --> 01:14:37,720
I was five. That's why you, when
you roll with a guy like that,

1356
01:14:37,721 --> 01:14:41,260
a lot of times he's a bodybuilder and
he feels like you can move them so well

1357
01:14:41,261 --> 01:14:44,590
and then you get some due to just as kind
of a thick neck and kind of like a big

1358
01:14:44,591 --> 01:14:48,160
base and just big legs and all
of sudden he's tank. You're like,

1359
01:14:48,161 --> 01:14:49,510
why can't even move you?

1360
01:14:49,710 --> 01:14:53,260
While the would a lot of people do that
or like bodybuilder type strength guys

1361
01:14:53,390 --> 01:14:55,060
ignore the legs and the back.

1362
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:57,310
Those are the most important
things for your movement,

1363
01:14:57,930 --> 01:15:01,780
your legs and all the way up through your
upper back. You know, your, your core,

1364
01:15:01,781 --> 01:15:06,070
like your ability to stay and keep your
own position and the ability to resist

1365
01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:09,250
being pushed around and your
ability to push off your legs.

1366
01:15:09,251 --> 01:15:10,240
That's the most important thing.

1367
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:12,820
So when guys are always like
doing like bench presses and shit,

1368
01:15:12,821 --> 01:15:16,030
like you're concentrating on the dumbest
shit you're concentrating on most of

1369
01:15:16,031 --> 01:15:18,470
the least important shit.
I was asked you, um,

1370
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:21,670
obviously I'm a huge UFC fan and that
you talk about this a lot so I don't want

1371
01:15:21,671 --> 01:15:23,170
to talk about it too much.
But um,

1372
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:25,840
one thing I always notice when I
watch it with a lot of my friends,

1373
01:15:25,841 --> 01:15:29,600
we always talk about how detailed your
knowledge is about the fight game and,

1374
01:15:29,601 --> 01:15:30,401
and you know,

1375
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:33,390
you've always been a fighter and you
boxed and you did a lot of taekwondo and

1376
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:37,780
you did and he wrestled and Jujitsu and
you continue to. But how much has your,

1377
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:41,170
um,
your understanding of fighting evolved?

1378
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:44,530
Do you think it's evolved a lot or have
you always kind of had it? Yeah, well,

1379
01:15:44,531 --> 01:15:48,610
you just watching the fights,
it, it evolves because you
see more things, you know,

1380
01:15:48,611 --> 01:15:51,910
you see more. I don't just watch
UFC always watched like k one,

1381
01:15:51,911 --> 01:15:56,911
like I'm a big fan of a k one kickboxing
and Muay Thai watching Brian and the

1382
01:15:57,341 --> 01:15:59,350
Jelly, the Jelly, the jelly is good too.

1383
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,680
But I don't know what you're talking
about. Don't you, you, when Jelly,

1384
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:05,770
I don't know what you're talking
about, split, but don't you think it's,

1385
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:10,210
but are you surprised that you're watching
really great wrestlers like Maynard

1386
01:16:10,211 --> 01:16:14,990
and uh, and, and um, uh, what's
his name? Frank. I under, yeah.

1387
01:16:14,991 --> 01:16:19,480
And watching to a top flight
college collegiate wrestlers box.

1388
01:16:19,481 --> 01:16:22,180
Now it's like becoming,
it looks like it's becoming,

1389
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:25,570
it's almost like I'm starting to
see why boxing even came about.

1390
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:29,770
It kind of like evolved into
boxing ultimately, you know?
Well, I don't think so.

1391
01:16:29,771 --> 01:16:33,360
I think what it is with those two guys
is they're both really good wrestlers.

1392
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:35,440
It's really hard to take each other down.
So it's almost like,

1393
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:39,820
and they want to stand and bang because
you know it, it starts to become like a,

1394
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:41,840
you know, a thing, you know,

1395
01:16:42,540 --> 01:16:44,710
he's going to meet me in the center of
the octagon and we're just going to swing

1396
01:16:44,711 --> 01:16:48,230
leather, you know, you know, hey, if
he wants to stay on with me, you know,

1397
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:51,700
there's a lot of that. So there's,
the guys want to knock guys out.

1398
01:16:51,701 --> 01:16:53,260
It's the best feeling in the world,
I'm sure.

1399
01:16:53,290 --> 01:16:54,790
And you guys want to submit guys too.

1400
01:16:55,030 --> 01:16:57,580
And I think both guys are
really difficult to take down.

1401
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:00,070
And so when you're really difficult
to take each other down, it's like,

1402
01:17:00,071 --> 01:17:02,530
what are we going to do? We're going to
try to take each other down over here.

1403
01:17:02,531 --> 01:17:05,050
No one wants to go to the crowd
anyway. It's exhausting. He'd rather,

1404
01:17:05,610 --> 01:17:07,600
you know what I mean? The
quickest way to win, I mean,

1405
01:17:07,601 --> 01:17:10,040
if you can't catch a submission,
obviously won by knockout and gray.

1406
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,890
Maynard had some heavy, heavy hands
as you saw in that fight. Dude,

1407
01:17:12,891 --> 01:17:15,680
I've never seen anybody hit so
many times in the first round.

1408
01:17:15,681 --> 01:17:20,060
Get hurt so many times and come back and
win the next round. It was incredible.

1409
01:17:20,061 --> 01:17:22,790
Incredible.
Maynard is a beast man.

1410
01:17:22,791 --> 01:17:26,720
He rocked him with a left hook and
then just started like beaten on a man.

1411
01:17:26,721 --> 01:17:30,470
I mean it was, do you see anybody else
seen them as high as one 90 he gets big.

1412
01:17:30,650 --> 01:17:33,950
It's big. He's a really thick
kid. He's very, very muscular.

1413
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,110
I know he's got those classical
all the way down on his hips.

1414
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:38,990
He's one of those guys that like when
he cuts, wait, he really, you know,

1415
01:17:38,991 --> 01:17:40,380
he has to die it for a long time.

1416
01:17:40,381 --> 01:17:43,020
Like he has to know in advance
when he's fighting, has to die.

1417
01:17:43,021 --> 01:17:47,480
It get his body fat real low and
then slowly dehydrate himself.

1418
01:17:47,480 --> 01:17:50,870
He said they have it down to a science.
So when he gets in the octagon,

1419
01:17:50,871 --> 01:17:54,730
he's not one 55 he's probably one 65
one seven nine somewhere around that.

1420
01:17:54,731 --> 01:17:58,730
And he's a, he's big. He's very
heavy. So super strong, you know.

1421
01:17:58,731 --> 01:18:02,180
And I couldn't believe that Frankie
Edgar butterflying take those shots, man.

1422
01:18:02,181 --> 01:18:06,680
It was crazy. He's, he's just incredible.
He just kept going and he would not quit.

1423
01:18:06,710 --> 01:18:09,170
It was several opportunities
for him to quit. Well,

1424
01:18:09,171 --> 01:18:11,570
he was just getting bombed on that.
If he wanted to give it up,

1425
01:18:11,571 --> 01:18:14,760
he could have just given it up. He
never for a minute quit. I'd be,

1426
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:18,920
it was so impressive to see how he
or manner did against Jose Aldo.

1427
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:23,000
You taught them well, they're going
to, apparently they got a rematch,

1428
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,150
which I think a these
guys going to rematch,

1429
01:18:25,190 --> 01:18:28,190
which I think is going to be fantastic.
You know, I think when you got to fight,

1430
01:18:28,191 --> 01:18:31,460
that's that close to God. It was so
close. There's so many arguments. Like,

1431
01:18:31,490 --> 01:18:34,060
you know, what was the first
rounds at a ten eight round was a,

1432
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:36,560
some guys have said it could have
been a tense seven. You know,

1433
01:18:36,561 --> 01:18:39,770
obviously I'm not a judge. I don't, I
don't really score the fights that way.

1434
01:18:39,771 --> 01:18:42,860
But I think, you know, if I,
if I looked at it, you know,

1435
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:46,820
you looked at it like as far as rounds
one and you know, butterfly it's close.

1436
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:49,070
It's real close. Right. The
big thing is the first round.

1437
01:18:49,071 --> 01:18:52,040
How much damage did you give
Maynard in the first round?

1438
01:18:52,041 --> 01:18:53,870
Because a lot of the other
rounds are like, man,

1439
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:55,370
there's a few of them
that were really close,

1440
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:58,010
just incredible that Acre could come
back like that. It's incredible.

1441
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:00,980
It's in grant. What's your calling? The
uh, Maynard adjusted really well too,

1442
01:19:00,981 --> 01:19:03,980
cause he almost punched himself
out in the, in this first round.

1443
01:19:03,981 --> 01:19:05,690
And I saw that I was having a hard time,

1444
01:19:06,050 --> 01:19:09,110
but then the third round he got loose
again. So he came right back. So you know,

1445
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:13,520
when you've been wrestling since you
were that young and you've been learning

1446
01:19:13,521 --> 01:19:16,040
how to suck weight and you,
and you have to train that hard,

1447
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:18,040
they're sewed mentally tough.
You know,

1448
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:21,920
I the most mentally tough and I went to
Dan Gables intensive wrestling camp and

1449
01:19:21,921 --> 01:19:25,280
I was in high school and they train
us so bad. It's so hard. I, I,

1450
01:19:25,281 --> 01:19:28,040
that's when I decided I'm not wrestling
in college, so he was just a nightmare.

1451
01:19:28,041 --> 01:19:30,770
I'm not doing this.
And Dan Gable guys famous for that.

1452
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:34,490
Well you know Dan Gable also has like two
hip replacements and two to fact knees.

1453
01:19:34,491 --> 01:19:38,330
Yeah, that's crazy. He really literally
wore his body down to the bone.

1454
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:42,080
Well he does that with his Rassler's um,
apparently it's a mental thing.

1455
01:19:42,081 --> 01:19:44,930
Like he'll, he'll just wear you
down to the point where, you know,

1456
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:48,170
the real interesting argument about
that as the eastern Europeans,

1457
01:19:48,230 --> 01:19:51,860
they don't do it though.
There's like a bunch of mother butterflyers.

1458
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:55,290
I swear to God it just looks the other
phone. I have two phones in my office.

1459
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:58,850
Shit. That's what happens
when you're a billionaire.

1460
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:02,210
You know when you're a kid and your mom
told you to don't crack your knuckles,

1461
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,710
it makes your fist bigger. What's that?
Do you remember when you were a kid?

1462
01:20:07,711 --> 01:20:09,930
Your mom told you not to crack your
knuckles cause it'll make her knuckles

1463
01:20:09,931 --> 01:20:12,480
bigger. Did you ever hear that as great?
Yeah. I always thought like, Oh yeah,

1464
01:20:12,481 --> 01:20:15,630
my crack my knuckles. So I have a bigger
fish and I could punch people better.

1465
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:19,410
I think I just started cracking all my
knuckles to think that's how I'm building

1466
01:20:19,411 --> 01:20:23,070
my body's muscle up and I forgot that.
That doesn't really work. Like, Oh man,

1467
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:26,400
I'm just glad I'm not a, I don't have
to fight for a living and that's it.

1468
01:20:26,401 --> 01:20:29,490
Hard life.
I respect those guys are phone problems.

1469
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:34,040
I swear to God I disconnected
bolt of them. Yeah.

1470
01:20:34,150 --> 01:20:36,930
Get rid of your home phones. Who
uses home phone? What's your call?

1471
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:39,360
What's your call on up here?
There's no cellular service.

1472
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:42,860
What's your call on silver bells.

1473
01:20:42,950 --> 01:20:45,180
[inaudible] Anderson is
an interesting fight.

1474
01:20:45,181 --> 01:20:49,530
You know Vitor is a really dangerous guy.

1475
01:20:50,030 --> 01:20:53,940
Like as far as like a box on his,
yeah, his hands. He's really dangerous.

1476
01:20:54,210 --> 01:20:58,190
So fast. You started rich Franklin fight,
quickie took out. Franklin's crazy.

1477
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:02,670
If he unloads on you like that and catches
you, he comes with a swarm of punches.

1478
01:21:02,670 --> 01:21:05,730
Man. I know. The only problem with
vittores had this in the past.

1479
01:21:05,950 --> 01:21:09,420
He just had a harder time in like the
second and third rounds maintain the same

1480
01:21:09,421 --> 01:21:13,230
intensity. But uh, and he's
had some mental issues, but
he had to like a really,

1481
01:21:13,231 --> 01:21:15,330
a lot of like real
serious personal issues.

1482
01:21:15,690 --> 01:21:20,130
Like his sister was kidnapped
and murdered. Yeah. A lot
of hard stuff happening.

1483
01:21:20,131 --> 01:21:23,840
First thing they ever go through it. And
then he's such a sweet person, you know,

1484
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:25,290
you have to make a living
so you have to fight.

1485
01:21:25,291 --> 01:21:27,750
So you're forced to take fights when
you're not in a good state. And,

1486
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:29,280
and I'm not making any
excuses for the guy,

1487
01:21:29,281 --> 01:21:33,540
but traditionally if you watch his fights,
he's very,

1488
01:21:33,541 --> 01:21:36,660
very strong in the beginning of the
fight issues that he has is in second and

1489
01:21:36,661 --> 01:21:37,494
third rounds.
Yeah.

1490
01:21:37,770 --> 01:21:41,730
So at one 85 the idea is that he killed
those issues because it was before it

1491
01:21:41,731 --> 01:21:44,940
was that he was carrying her on too much
muscle and now he's much leaner at one

1492
01:21:44,941 --> 01:21:46,870
85 which was his natural way,
isn't it?

1493
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:49,590
He's probably a bit bigger than
that in real life, you know,

1494
01:21:49,591 --> 01:21:52,410
probably closer to 200 pounds.
But you know when he's in lean shape,

1495
01:21:52,411 --> 01:21:55,500
like ready for a fight. Yeah, I
suppose he's so ridiculously athletic.

1496
01:21:55,501 --> 01:21:59,240
He always was super fast.
Like his, his reflexes are,

1497
01:21:59,930 --> 01:22:02,160
it's very good. Yeah. You know he's had,

1498
01:22:02,580 --> 01:22:05,280
he's had some issues in the past
like Alistair Overeem submitted them,

1499
01:22:05,281 --> 01:22:08,580
but you know, the reality is a lot of that
was probably fatigue. If you're tired,

1500
01:22:08,581 --> 01:22:11,040
man, you leave your neck out there
and a guy like Al Star jumps on it.

1501
01:22:11,041 --> 01:22:12,770
It doesn't matter who you
are. No it doesn't. You know,

1502
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:16,050
if you're finding them and may find you're
not adequately, physically prepared,

1503
01:22:16,051 --> 01:22:19,590
it's, you're going to do some
students show, it's why to me MMA is,

1504
01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:23,340
is the greatest sport because
it requires everything.

1505
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:27,740
It requires like literally
not just your courage and,

1506
01:22:27,741 --> 01:22:31,950
and you have to be in top physical
shape, but you know, anything can happen.

1507
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:35,490
The margin for error is so slim.
You make one mistake,

1508
01:22:35,491 --> 01:22:38,940
you get tired and even the training
that you have to go through to become a

1509
01:22:38,941 --> 01:22:41,310
really good boxer,
to become a really good wrestler,

1510
01:22:41,311 --> 01:22:43,350
to become and to stay
in really good shape.

1511
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:48,530
That's just a full time job all the
time. Yeah. And what happens is you,

1512
01:22:48,531 --> 01:22:51,100
you mean you, you have to decide where
you're going to dedicate your time.

1513
01:22:51,101 --> 01:22:52,650
Is it going to be in a
strength and conditioning?

1514
01:22:52,810 --> 01:22:54,540
Is it going to be to work in your skills?

1515
01:22:54,541 --> 01:22:57,360
Cause you only have a certain amount of
hours in a day and a certain amount of

1516
01:22:57,450 --> 01:23:00,160
resources in your physical
body, you know. Exactly.

1517
01:23:00,210 --> 01:23:02,660
You're going to burn yourself out to
the point where you can't recover and,

1518
01:23:02,661 --> 01:23:04,860
and there's no money in it. I mean,
the other thing, especially in the,

1519
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,390
and this job man,
it's like worked at high levels.

1520
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:09,910
There is though at the high levels
there's rock star money. You know,

1521
01:23:09,911 --> 01:23:11,230
like George Saint Pierre is balling.

1522
01:23:11,470 --> 01:23:15,160
That guy's making ridiculous raising money
and Brock Lesnar made ridiculous one.

1523
01:23:15,161 --> 01:23:18,200
Yeah. I mean anybody who can sell tickets,
chocolate dealt ridiculous money. Yeah.

1524
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,830
But it's the guys who can
sell, you know, paper views.

1525
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:22,450
They can write the guys who can,
you know,

1526
01:23:22,451 --> 01:23:24,880
get a piece of the action guys who were,
you know,

1527
01:23:24,890 --> 01:23:27,520
who are legit starts with what
the UFC has done that so smart,

1528
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:30,400
you know that a lot of people have
said about is they've made the name UFC

1529
01:23:30,401 --> 01:23:33,070
bigger than any fight. That's the smartest
thing to do and went to ever done.

1530
01:23:33,170 --> 01:23:36,920
That's the whole thing is that the
brand name is bigger than any fight.

1531
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:41,080
And the good thing about that is that
everyone in the organization that's,

1532
01:23:41,170 --> 01:23:44,150
you know, it's in there, they can get
them to fight each other, you know,

1533
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:47,110
and when you have like outside of, there's
like a bunch of different promotions.

1534
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:50,560
The argument for that against that
rather is what's going on with Floyd

1535
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:53,020
Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao.
They just won't butterflying find each other.

1536
01:23:53,021 --> 01:23:56,710
It's like Floyd Mayweather just doesn't
want to find them and just keep it off.

1537
01:23:56,711 --> 01:23:59,050
And you know, I want
drug test thing. I want,

1538
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:02,830
I want to take his blood 10 minutes
before the fight, which is butterflying,

1539
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:05,800
I mean they just, they're convinced
many packages. I was on steroids.

1540
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:09,610
But then you look at his last fight, he
was 20 butterflying pounds. It's so crazy.

1541
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:14,611
The Margarita Margarita Margarita was
an animal and it's a big comeback fight

1542
01:24:15,701 --> 01:24:19,430
for him and walks around at one
75 whatever big dude and, and,

1543
01:24:19,431 --> 01:24:20,810
and has never actually been heard,

1544
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:25,840
I don't think Margarito and outlined that
and pack out just he figures your game

1545
01:24:25,901 --> 01:24:29,290
out mostly by the way, stopped them. So
I shouldn't say he has never been hurt.

1546
01:24:29,291 --> 01:24:30,760
That's not true.
I forgot about that fight.

1547
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,150
That was the fight where I can't
believe I forgot about the butterflyers.

1548
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:36,020
That was a fight where you get exposed
for having plaster in his gloves.

1549
01:24:36,021 --> 01:24:39,910
So that was, that was actually
the codified. No, no, no.
Oh, sugar. Shane Mosley. Yes,

1550
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:40,750
absolutely.

1551
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:44,380
That's why he came out
like almost projected and
humiliated and he was suspended

1552
01:24:44,381 --> 01:24:46,330
right out and sugar Shane
Mosley beat the butterflying shit.

1553
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:48,490
And that was a fight where
a lot of people were saying,

1554
01:24:48,491 --> 01:24:50,170
well one of the reasons why,
I bet he got his ass kicked.

1555
01:24:50,171 --> 01:24:51,970
He probably felt super guilty though.

1556
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,150
They got caught with his hand in the
cookie jar that he had been doing that to

1557
01:24:55,151 --> 01:24:59,300
people for a long time. A lot of people
suspected, oh sure. He like broke up code.

1558
01:24:59,310 --> 01:25:02,830
He broke up a lot of guys. It really,
really dangerous man. Frankly,

1559
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:04,630
to be honest with you,
I would have banned him for life for that.

1560
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:08,170
I mean it's kind of ridiculous that the
only got a year band. He's outrageous.

1561
01:25:08,171 --> 01:25:10,050
If they could prove that
he had done it more evil,

1562
01:25:10,070 --> 01:25:11,710
even just proving that you did it once.

1563
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:14,410
I also think I also personally think
anybody who does that and lets their

1564
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:15,211
trainer does do that.

1565
01:25:15,211 --> 01:25:20,110
I didn't the whole campus scumbag and
then it's just a scumbag, shitty plaster.

1566
01:25:20,111 --> 01:25:24,430
In 2010 you putting plaster and
you're ramped worst. Wow. You know,

1567
01:25:24,431 --> 01:25:28,330
but meanwhile what I said Mack Manny
Pacquiao 20 pounds butterflying light or lights

1568
01:25:28,331 --> 01:25:30,580
him up like a Christmas tree.
Nobody's come close to this guy. He's,

1569
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:32,170
he's just probably the
greatest fighter ever.

1570
01:25:32,410 --> 01:25:33,720
I really think he's greatest boxer ever.

1571
01:25:33,721 --> 01:25:35,680
It's one in eight different
weight divisions. I mean,

1572
01:25:35,681 --> 01:25:38,800
how do you argue against that? Right.
I mean, if you see what he does to all,

1573
01:25:38,801 --> 01:25:42,700
to all these different fires, he's a
politician too. Oh, and by the way,

1574
01:25:42,701 --> 01:25:44,440
when he fights all of his country,

1575
01:25:44,441 --> 01:25:48,760
all of the Philippines stops to watch
crime goes down. No pressure, Manny.

1576
01:25:48,970 --> 01:25:51,340
And he goes in there like,
hey, what's up everybody? Hi,

1577
01:25:51,341 --> 01:25:55,300
how he's waving due to in the stands
before he even tried to hype up this fight

1578
01:25:55,301 --> 01:25:58,120
by talking about, you know how his
training camp hasn't been going so good.

1579
01:25:58,121 --> 01:26:01,990
Like you watched the Hbo 24 Seven Man,
he's so distracted, Manson distracted.

1580
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:03,170
Meanwhile he gets in there,

1581
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:08,270
I got this thing that dude's just
watching the fireworks go off.

1582
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:10,250
He's standing in front
of that little butterflying,

1583
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:13,100
that butterflying little lightning
bolts fly lefted right.

1584
01:26:13,101 --> 01:26:16,010
And is he seeing little sparks in
front of his eyes every 10 seconds?

1585
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:19,100
He's like Roberto Duran when he
was younger, but, but way better.

1586
01:26:19,101 --> 01:26:22,220
Like he's so touches his belt.
He comes in and does that weird.

1587
01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:26,210
He loves fighting to men even
though he has so much to lose,

1588
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:28,910
he still loves fighting
and he's a born fighter.

1589
01:26:28,940 --> 01:26:31,070
That's what I think is that
the hardest thing is when you,

1590
01:26:31,071 --> 01:26:34,850
when you become that biggest celebrity
and you have that many fans and you get

1591
01:26:34,851 --> 01:26:35,684
into a ring,

1592
01:26:35,810 --> 01:26:40,190
you have a lot to lose and
the great champions can
somehow put that out of their

1593
01:26:40,191 --> 01:26:44,440
heads and he seems like he makes him
elevate. It makes him better. You know?

1594
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:47,780
He seems like the weight of these people
behind them just make some better.

1595
01:26:47,930 --> 01:26:49,820
Some people are, you know, some people
would talk trash, it doesn't work.

1596
01:26:49,821 --> 01:26:52,520
So I'm other people do like chill Sona
and obviously talking trash away does,

1597
01:26:52,530 --> 01:26:54,110
it helps them. It works
for him. I don't know.

1598
01:26:54,290 --> 01:26:57,800
Well the thing about Manny Pacquiao too
is that he seems to be doing everything

1599
01:26:57,801 --> 01:27:01,880
perfectly. He like, he seems
to be a really nice guy.
Yeah. It didn't. You tell me.

1600
01:27:01,881 --> 01:27:06,530
He also plays a pool, like I'm going
to be, well level plays better than me.

1601
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:09,080
No one thing that doesn't
fashional level pool, that's crazy.

1602
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:13,190
He's not good at is singing apparently.
Well yeah, he plays Karaoke and shit,

1603
01:27:13,191 --> 01:27:15,290
but give them some time.
I'll probably get good at that too.

1604
01:27:15,291 --> 01:27:17,740
If you really want it to,
we'll be with you by an Italian.

1605
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,040
I'm going up shit about his thinking.

1606
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:22,460
He'll probably higher voice coaches
and just become one of the badass opera

1607
01:27:22,461 --> 01:27:24,710
singers of our generation.
Never be able to deny him.

1608
01:27:24,770 --> 01:27:28,760
He's just a bad motherbutterflyer paid versus
old Tyson. Who would you go with? Wow.

1609
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:33,210
Coming from, he's a tiny guy. No, but
if it was, if they were the same size,

1610
01:27:34,190 --> 01:27:37,040
that was the most interesting thing
about Tyson when he was young is that he

1611
01:27:37,041 --> 01:27:39,200
moved like a man much smaller than him.

1612
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:41,840
You watched like the Mike
Tyson Marvis Frazier fight.

1613
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:44,630
That is one of the most
disturbing boxing matches ever.

1614
01:27:44,631 --> 01:27:47,960
Cause Marvis knew what was going to
happen. We knew it was going to happen.

1615
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:50,810
Tyson knew it was going to happen. The
announcers knew it was going to happen.

1616
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,760
You know, they were all talking
about it. This is, you know,

1617
01:27:52,761 --> 01:27:55,950
a lot of people saying this is a
mismatch and then Tyson just comes rare,

1618
01:27:55,951 --> 01:28:00,020
renowned him moving
like, like in, in frames.

1619
01:28:00,110 --> 01:28:03,380
You're not even seeing all
of his movements because
he's moving so God damn fast

1620
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:07,310
and all of a sudden he's hurling these
left hooks in your direction and you feel

1621
01:28:07,311 --> 01:28:11,060
your rib cage imploding and
before you even react to it,

1622
01:28:11,061 --> 01:28:12,740
another one's hit you on
the other side of the head.

1623
01:28:12,770 --> 01:28:16,460
He was having trouble finding sparring
partners cause he was crushing people too

1624
01:28:16,461 --> 01:28:20,940
badly. He moves so fast. That was the
thing. He didn't move like Ali where he,

1625
01:28:20,941 --> 01:28:24,740
you know, would move with fancy footwork
and dance around Joe Frazier style.

1626
01:28:24,741 --> 01:28:27,950
You know, but, but, but different
because with both hands, you know,

1627
01:28:27,951 --> 01:28:31,070
he would throw rights and laughs
with equal abandoned, you know,

1628
01:28:31,071 --> 01:28:33,980
whereas Joe Frazier was a big left
hooker and he had a diesel right hand,

1629
01:28:33,981 --> 01:28:37,310
but it was nothing like Tyson's, Tyson's
famous for that right hook to the body.

1630
01:28:37,311 --> 01:28:41,930
Right uppercut combination. He was
a butterflying, for one brief moment,

1631
01:28:41,931 --> 01:28:45,290
one brief period of history,
he changed that whole sport.

1632
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:50,300
He changed watching boxing,
watching boxing was never
watching an execution. Okay.

1633
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:52,400
It wouldn't,
Marvin Hagler was fighting good guys.

1634
01:28:52,401 --> 01:28:55,480
Like when he was fighting John the beats
Mugabi. It was like a big fight, right?

1635
01:28:55,490 --> 01:28:58,720
Everybody got excited about it. Like,
Holy Shit, I'm [inaudible] punch it.

1636
01:28:58,730 --> 01:29:01,890
And it was a fight to macaby knocked
out Terry Norris Mugabe is a bad

1637
01:29:01,891 --> 01:29:03,990
motherbutterflyer. Mugabe's get
serious power. You know,

1638
01:29:03,991 --> 01:29:08,280
this could be the fight for Hagler
Mike Tyson's fights were executions.

1639
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:10,440
It's like, here's Bruce
Seldon, here's Mike Tyson.

1640
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:12,570
Look at Bruce Selvans knees shake.
You know,

1641
01:29:12,571 --> 01:29:15,510
all of a sudden Tyson's charging after
him. Boom. The fights over. Well,

1642
01:29:15,511 --> 01:29:16,430
you know what they said is that

1643
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:21,280
uh, Don king used to set up monitors
and he'd have a highlight reel of Tyson

1644
01:29:21,281 --> 01:29:22,990
knocking dudes out and when
you are going to fight him,

1645
01:29:22,991 --> 01:29:25,670
he would always step the monitors up.
So the fighter in the MGM,

1646
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:29,530
when it would have to walk through that,
oh my God, Don king was nuts that way.

1647
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:32,380
And so you'd be fighting and you'd
just see these highlight reels of him.

1648
01:29:34,420 --> 01:29:39,140
I just crushed it in slow motion. That
makes sense. It's the monitor attached.

1649
01:29:39,141 --> 01:29:42,740
Fantastic. You got to go fight Mike Tyson.
Some of those guys were so intimidated.

1650
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:44,340
That's a huge,

1651
01:29:44,340 --> 01:29:49,190
I met him one time in Vegas at Dyson
and you just get put on weight,

1652
01:29:49,191 --> 01:29:53,120
but he's so thick, like his
hand is so thick. His, his,

1653
01:29:53,210 --> 01:29:56,270
his hips in his head,
everything is just so wide.

1654
01:29:56,271 --> 01:29:58,340
You're like [inaudible] just
a different human being.

1655
01:29:58,341 --> 01:30:03,230
I never grew while he's locked.
He was just so compact and fast.

1656
01:30:03,470 --> 01:30:06,530
He was a new model heavyweights
and six feet tall. Me To me,

1657
01:30:06,531 --> 01:30:08,490
like if you would've picked
the prototype of what I,

1658
01:30:08,540 --> 01:30:11,570
what I like just the ultimate
like top of the food chain dude.

1659
01:30:11,690 --> 01:30:15,110
That's what I'd like to look like. I
always wear black shorts and black shoes.

1660
01:30:15,111 --> 01:30:18,800
Do you remember when he came out of prison
and he was super yolked like he came

1661
01:30:18,801 --> 01:30:19,640
into prison,
that prison,

1662
01:30:19,641 --> 01:30:24,170
all he was doing was push ups and sit ups
and tat tips and getting tattooed with

1663
01:30:24,171 --> 01:30:27,910
butterflying are controversial.
Pete's Rashers Take Kong mouth.

1664
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:31,820
They don't kill about 40 million
people crazies. The Arthur Ashe Tattoo.

1665
01:30:31,821 --> 01:30:36,770
It's like, all right dude, I got ya. Okay
grace. He's a fantastic mother butterflyer.

1666
01:30:36,771 --> 01:30:39,430
Che Guevara.
He's got take tattooed on him today.

1667
01:30:39,690 --> 01:30:44,240
It doesn't mean Che and Oh yeah,
he's a fascinating motherbutterflyer, man.

1668
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:47,750
For that brief moment. Look, I said
that he changed the whole sport,

1669
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:50,470
changed the whole sport and he lost
his trainer. Right, right. Well,

1670
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,850
I lost a bunch of things. There was a
bunch of things that happen, you know,

1671
01:30:52,851 --> 01:30:54,170
fame happened and it also,

1672
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:58,100
it's almost impossible to keep up the
level of Rpms that he was operating at.

1673
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:00,080
You know,
when he was at the very top of his game,

1674
01:31:00,081 --> 01:31:03,050
when he was like challenging for the
heavyweight title and it was training,

1675
01:31:03,051 --> 01:31:05,060
you know, getting up at five o'clock
in the morning every time, running.

1676
01:31:05,270 --> 01:31:06,510
What's once,
you know,

1677
01:31:06,650 --> 01:31:09,710
once girls start coming into the picture
and money starts coming in the picture,

1678
01:31:09,711 --> 01:31:13,490
and he said to Todd Phillips recently and
the hangover two, and he goes, he goes,

1679
01:31:13,491 --> 01:31:15,770
I'm that, Todd told me this
story. And it was funny,

1680
01:31:15,771 --> 01:31:18,470
we were talking about the power of
women and how, you know, it never,

1681
01:31:18,550 --> 01:31:21,110
no matter how much money you make
and stuff and they're all women,

1682
01:31:21,210 --> 01:31:23,900
well it's kind of in a rush,
you know, and, and uh, and,

1683
01:31:23,901 --> 01:31:28,080
and Mike Tyson said to tiny goes, man,
I've heard it all. I've had, I've had, um,

1684
01:31:28,170 --> 01:31:30,120
I've had money, I've had fame. Uh,

1685
01:31:30,121 --> 01:31:33,030
but if God invented anything better
than poor thethe keeping it for himself.

1686
01:31:38,150 --> 01:31:38,983
Yeah.

1687
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:43,780
Oh, he's keeping it for himself.
That's brilliant. Oh my God.

1688
01:31:43,781 --> 01:31:48,340
That might be the wisest thing anyone's
ever said. All right man. That's genius.

1689
01:31:48,370 --> 01:31:52,300
That should be in a book somewhere.
Someone folks, someone put that,

1690
01:31:52,330 --> 01:31:55,030
put that as your Avatar is your
signature at the bottom. You know,

1691
01:31:55,031 --> 01:31:58,900
you want to do that free screen
name. You need that. God Damn, that's

1692
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:02,560
did you said that guide that we talked
about yesterday, I don't know if you saw,

1693
01:32:02,561 --> 01:32:03,394
those are not Brian.

1694
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:07,770
There's this homeless guy that has
this really awesome radio voice and uh,

1695
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:11,800
he was a bum on the side of the road
and this guy just filmed them and like,

1696
01:32:11,801 --> 01:32:13,030
you know, it like here, you know,

1697
01:32:13,031 --> 01:32:15,580
here's some money and the guides
of wide thank you very much.

1698
01:32:15,581 --> 01:32:17,980
And it was just like the most
creepiest video. Anyways,

1699
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:22,160
a day after like he's really
probably play it for Brian's. Right?

1700
01:32:22,410 --> 01:32:23,190
It's really quick.

1701
01:32:23,190 --> 01:32:26,570
Oh, sorry. I wish I, I've always
wanted to have, you can do butterfly Outta,

1702
01:32:26,580 --> 01:32:29,080
you can do any voice to
tell people that I want,

1703
01:32:29,090 --> 01:32:31,920
I want a voice like this is just natural.
It's just got a lot of gravel in it.

1704
01:32:31,921 --> 01:32:36,921
Just a sexy kind of like a lumberjack was
just a guy who keeps you real calm and

1705
01:32:37,141 --> 01:32:40,720
get you a real horn.
It when he talks how old he is,

1706
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:45,510
your maker either love master 17 years
old. He looked at it, but a 20 to me.

1707
01:32:45,511 --> 01:32:46,500
All right,

1708
01:32:47,090 --> 01:32:51,510
right. Sorry. Crepey sorry. I'll
wait. No, that's not it. Great.

1709
01:32:51,511 --> 01:32:52,860
And now this place is flooded,

1710
01:32:52,870 --> 01:32:55,690
dude. I always tell people there's
two, two funniest moments now.

1711
01:32:55,691 --> 01:32:59,110
The funniest moments ever.
One of them was in the hotel,

1712
01:32:59,230 --> 01:33:03,340
you and me and Eddie Bravo and Larry and
a couple other dudes and we were really

1713
01:33:03,341 --> 01:33:07,390
super banked and you went into your
Brazilian Jujitsu rapist character.

1714
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:12,950
Oh my God, Dude. I remember laughing
until I literally couldn't breathe.

1715
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:16,180
Like I've said, this is, this is the
funniest moment I've ever had in my life.

1716
01:33:16,450 --> 01:33:19,960
There's that moment. And the other moment
is Joey Diaz on the Alex Jones show.

1717
01:33:20,020 --> 01:33:22,060
Those to me, I haven't seen
that. You have to say it.

1718
01:33:22,150 --> 01:33:25,230
It's the most ridiculous thing ever. Joe,
you know Alex Jones show is all kept.

1719
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:29,920
Trails are taking up our sky.
Kate bio chips, they're doing it,

1720
01:33:29,921 --> 01:33:32,920
they're putting it
inside children's cereal.

1721
01:33:32,950 --> 01:33:35,220
Ladies and gentlemen with the elitist,

1722
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:39,550
they want to lower the population
and vaccines and you know,

1723
01:33:39,551 --> 01:33:43,510
it's all like crazy. We need
to buy gold. He gets nutty.

1724
01:33:44,550 --> 01:33:47,590
Joey DNS comes on because Alex is my
friend and I've known Alex for like 10

1725
01:33:47,591 --> 01:33:49,630
years and he's right about
a lot of things. I mean,

1726
01:33:49,631 --> 01:33:51,150
he's really right about
a lot of things here.

1727
01:33:51,490 --> 01:33:54,070
And I think the only way to chase
things down the way that guy does,

1728
01:33:54,071 --> 01:33:57,580
you gotta be a little loony. So he's
a little loony, but he's a great guy.

1729
01:33:57,581 --> 01:34:01,690
Alex Jones is a great guy, but he's
got this conspiracy theories theory,

1730
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:04,030
a right wing kind of a radio show.

1731
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:08,620
And Joey comes on it and we go onto
the internet break. But grind Q,

1732
01:34:08,621 --> 01:34:11,920
that shit up. We go into the homeless
guy. You, I played the homeless guy.

1733
01:34:11,921 --> 01:34:13,930
First Day.
I'm gonna make you work for your dollar.

1734
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:17,090
Say something with that great radio voice
when you're listening to nothing but

1735
01:34:17,091 --> 01:34:21,590
the best of oldies. You're listening to
magic 98.9 all right, you can take it.

1736
01:34:21,591 --> 01:34:22,430
You so much.

1737
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:26,500
That's how I use it. So that guy got a
job that was so anyways, yesterday that,

1738
01:34:26,540 --> 01:34:28,700
that,
that video hit today.

1739
01:34:28,701 --> 01:34:32,990
The was it the colts gave him a
house and a job working for him.

1740
01:34:32,991 --> 01:34:34,370
Is it the cult? I think, yeah,

1741
01:34:34,371 --> 01:34:37,910
the Cleveland Colts or whoever
the Cleveland Cleveland is.

1742
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:42,860
It's great. If I didn't find out what is,
cause it's give them props with Kevin.

1743
01:34:42,861 --> 01:34:44,870
Here's the Cleveland Cavaliers.
Cavaliers,

1744
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:48,020
the calves I should have
or a basketball team.

1745
01:34:48,630 --> 01:34:51,770
So they picked him up as the
announcer. Yeah, they pick, well,

1746
01:34:51,771 --> 01:34:55,190
they offered Williams a full time job
doing voiceover work for the team and a

1747
01:34:55,191 --> 01:34:58,750
free home in Cleveland
to the is a motherbutterflyer.

1748
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:02,450
Love it. I love it. In one day
that guy, he's got a house,

1749
01:35:02,760 --> 01:35:07,010
there's all all together.
It's beautiful and it's a great story.

1750
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:10,150
Brilliant PR move for life.

1751
01:35:10,690 --> 01:35:12,810
Friend was giggling and showed
me this thing and I looked at it.

1752
01:35:12,811 --> 01:35:16,370
It was a man I was trading himself and I
was like, yeah, I've seen a few of those.

1753
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:18,190
I was like, great. That's what,
I don't need the internet.

1754
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:22,760
I watched one where a guy, um, tied
off his balls with rubber bands,

1755
01:35:23,150 --> 01:35:27,770
detailed every single aspect of the
balls dying and him cutting off the balls

1756
01:35:27,771 --> 01:35:32,600
with a serrated knife. I didn't see
that. I saw the hatchet job. Oh, crime.

1757
01:35:32,601 --> 01:35:36,470
Any crime, any crime. Money. There's a lot
of crazy motherbutterflyers out there, dude.

1758
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:38,000
God Damn.

1759
01:35:38,090 --> 01:35:41,060
I wonder if this home is shit's going to
catch on and all these homeless people

1760
01:35:41,061 --> 01:35:42,980
are going to start trying to do voices.
So now there's,

1761
01:35:42,981 --> 01:35:46,060
this can be tons of homeless people coming
up. You going, hey, how's it going? Hey,

1762
01:35:46,061 --> 01:35:46,730
can I have someone?

1763
01:35:46,730 --> 01:35:50,690
I think there'll be like a slow like
incubation period before it hits the

1764
01:35:50,691 --> 01:35:52,460
homeless people because most of
them don't have any internet.

1765
01:35:52,850 --> 01:35:55,880
So it's going to take like six months
of somebody trying to drag them into a

1766
01:35:55,881 --> 01:36:00,320
library. Mcgee, go see this cause it
heroin. If it's not, I'm not going. Huh.

1767
01:36:00,590 --> 01:36:05,590
And then not January, this
guy got a job. We need a neck.

1768
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:07,610
This is like a Fred Flintstone.

1769
01:36:09,020 --> 01:36:12,110
Unless they start eating to Barney
rubble and let's they start reading their

1770
01:36:12,111 --> 01:36:14,570
toilet paper, you know, I'm like, oh no.

1771
01:36:14,630 --> 01:36:16,940
Do you remember Fred Flintstone and
Barney rubble? They're always like,

1772
01:36:16,941 --> 01:36:18,900
there's always scams to
coming up with things.

1773
01:36:19,070 --> 01:36:22,940
They always had some new skins come up
with an eye. We're going to start a band.

1774
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:26,150
You remember, he was always like
trying to figure out his shit.

1775
01:36:26,270 --> 01:36:29,570
And his wife was always cock blocking and
holding them down. My Buddy, my buddy,

1776
01:36:29,571 --> 01:36:34,280
uh, it has Asperger's syndrome really?
And he's 50 and he's really smart,

1777
01:36:34,281 --> 01:36:37,350
but he's also completely crazy. And we
were driving and he's 15. It looks to me,

1778
01:36:37,390 --> 01:36:41,350
he goes, he goes, I'm thinking about
something. I go, what? He goes,

1779
01:36:42,040 --> 01:36:46,450
I think we should start a band. And I go,
wow, that's a really good idea. Johnny,

1780
01:36:48,770 --> 01:36:50,980
is he driving a, you drive?
I'm driving. He goes, thank God

1781
01:36:51,090 --> 01:36:53,610
you gotta do you think
so? I go, I do think so.

1782
01:36:54,150 --> 01:36:56,670
The only issue is that I don't think
either one of us sings or plays an

1783
01:36:56,671 --> 01:36:59,880
instrument. So what would we
do? He goes, well, you know,

1784
01:36:59,881 --> 01:37:03,120
you're a charismatic so you could figure
something out, you know, and I would,

1785
01:37:03,150 --> 01:37:08,130
I do sing, I do sing. Um, I, I've
always had music inside of me. I go,

1786
01:37:08,131 --> 01:37:11,190
okay, but if you saying, that's
good, I don't, I'm a shower singer,

1787
01:37:11,191 --> 01:37:13,380
so what would I do? And
he was like, you know,

1788
01:37:13,381 --> 01:37:16,650
like just the tambourine and plus you
could just be the leader of the band.

1789
01:37:18,150 --> 01:37:20,230
I was like, you're the greatest
human being old time at.

1790
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:22,650
I'll do that in a heartbeat.
So anyway,

1791
01:37:22,651 --> 01:37:26,070
anybody who wants to join me and Johnny's
band, please, please give me a call.

1792
01:37:26,170 --> 01:37:27,760
Can they get a hold of you on Twitter?

1793
01:37:27,830 --> 01:37:30,790
Are you going to have auditions
for the band? You know, I
would, I, you know, for me,

1794
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:33,280
I just, it's funny, I wish I
played an instrument. I don't,

1795
01:37:33,281 --> 01:37:34,570
I never had the patients.
What's,

1796
01:37:34,571 --> 01:37:37,390
what fascinates me is why some
people choose certain instruments.

1797
01:37:37,391 --> 01:37:41,260
Like the guitar, I get it, you get laid
the piano and the drums, but the Tuba,

1798
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:43,870
that's the dumbest butterflying instrument.
Like there's not even a,

1799
01:37:44,020 --> 01:37:45,940
there's not even a song.
Really. Yeah. You just,

1800
01:37:45,941 --> 01:37:48,040
you need a huge brass band
and you only play like

1801
01:37:48,110 --> 01:37:52,460
boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
You know, there's no really
like full songs for the two.

1802
01:37:52,461 --> 01:37:55,810
But we're like, um, what
else does a couple of the

1803
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:59,400
accordion, certain things that
people have a calling for that are,

1804
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:02,700
that fascinated me. I always
just slow, what was that movie?

1805
01:38:02,701 --> 01:38:07,701
The Spike Lee movie about jazz
with Denzel Washington movie.

1806
01:38:07,890 --> 01:38:10,050
What was that quote?
Better Blues Blues.

1807
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:13,040
And I still love watching like,

1808
01:38:13,290 --> 01:38:17,130
like the part where Denzel Washington
would take out his trumpet and he would

1809
01:38:17,131 --> 01:38:17,880
clean it.

1810
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:21,660
It was like a ritual and then he would
go through all his practice routines.

1811
01:38:21,661 --> 01:38:24,600
Like he was so disciplined
about his practice. Tropics,

1812
01:38:24,601 --> 01:38:27,190
we try to get at them and be like, I've
got a practice, I got to find a, yeah,

1813
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:27,511
you know,

1814
01:38:27,511 --> 01:38:31,080
Wynton Marsalis talks about that he's
considered by many to be the greatest jazz

1815
01:38:31,081 --> 01:38:33,150
trumpeter, you know, in
the world. And as he,

1816
01:38:33,151 --> 01:38:35,070
the dude that was on the tonight
show or was it his brother?

1817
01:38:35,490 --> 01:38:36,620
His brother Brandford.
But um,

1818
01:38:36,810 --> 01:38:41,490
but witness is considered a real real
maestro. Like, like in the, in the,

1819
01:38:41,491 --> 01:38:46,430
in the, in the same pantheon is
like, Yo, yo ma or even even, uh,

1820
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:49,910
Louie Armstrong. I mean, so he's just
completely dedicated to the [inaudible].

1821
01:38:50,010 --> 01:38:51,150
By the time he was 19,

1822
01:38:51,151 --> 01:38:56,151
he was on a physical technical level with
the trumpet that was so far superseded

1823
01:38:56,161 --> 01:38:58,920
anybody in the field. Almost,
and, and they also say,

1824
01:38:58,921 --> 01:39:01,020
and I've heard this from people
like Harry Connick Jr and stuff,

1825
01:39:01,021 --> 01:39:02,910
we say that he does things on a trumpet.

1826
01:39:02,911 --> 01:39:05,820
You're not physically supposed to
be able to do like your fingers.

1827
01:39:05,890 --> 01:39:08,220
I'm supposed to be able to do that stuff.
Yeah.

1828
01:39:08,221 --> 01:39:10,250
And cause he can just move them so fast.

1829
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:12,750
Such dexterity and the
things that he does, but

1830
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:16,160
talks a lot about, um, you know, just,

1831
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:21,080
just what practice means and the kind
of thing that I believe he's still blows

1832
01:39:21,081 --> 01:39:24,880
on a read an hour a day, you know,
which is like a beginners thing. But,

1833
01:39:24,890 --> 01:39:28,880
but he says if, you
know, the daily practice,

1834
01:39:28,881 --> 01:39:33,260
the daily adherence to practice is what,
what changes everything.

1835
01:39:33,410 --> 01:39:34,250
And not only that,

1836
01:39:34,251 --> 01:39:36,860
he also talks about like when you do a
performance and you come off and you've

1837
01:39:36,861 --> 01:39:41,150
got a high and if you killed it, that
energy, a lot of people go, well,

1838
01:39:41,151 --> 01:39:44,530
I'm going to have a couple of drinks and
celebrate actually what a guy like that

1839
01:39:44,531 --> 01:39:46,910
we'll do is go, I've got all
this new, all this new energy.

1840
01:39:47,060 --> 01:39:48,470
And he goes and shuts himself in the room.

1841
01:39:48,471 --> 01:39:52,430
And practices even more with that
new found sort of rush, that energy.

1842
01:39:52,850 --> 01:39:53,541
And you know,

1843
01:39:53,541 --> 01:39:57,950
he talks about the difference between
being truly great and truly original and

1844
01:39:57,951 --> 01:40:02,930
being like everybody else is or those
kinds of, those kinds of things.

1845
01:40:02,931 --> 01:40:04,970
You know,
like pushing yourself to that level.

1846
01:40:04,971 --> 01:40:06,620
Everybody has their own process of course,

1847
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:09,290
but nobody practices as much as he does.

1848
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:13,230
Yeah. The discipline, the adherence
discipline is so attractive. You know,

1849
01:40:13,231 --> 01:40:16,460
in my mind it's like, so what I
would like to be doing, you know,

1850
01:40:17,230 --> 01:40:18,870
I stay as disciplined as I can,

1851
01:40:19,050 --> 01:40:23,130
but I'm so butterflying pulsive there's so
many different things entering into my

1852
01:40:23,131 --> 01:40:25,080
interest all the time had,
pardon me, says, well,

1853
01:40:25,081 --> 01:40:27,870
that's where some of my
creative creativity comes from,

1854
01:40:27,871 --> 01:40:31,150
is this fascination with a
constant need for, you know,

1855
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:34,260
all this new information and new
things and yeah, but it's also,

1856
01:40:34,261 --> 01:40:37,850
it's also a distraction.
Yeah. It's massive. And I
also think that in some ways,

1857
01:40:37,860 --> 01:40:40,050
like I always think that you get to a
certain point in your life where you,

1858
01:40:40,051 --> 01:40:40,740
in a way,
no,

1859
01:40:40,740 --> 01:40:44,280
everything that you need to know to
create something perfect and beautiful.

1860
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:49,200
But it's, it's new. Current Shit is
the most fascinating thing to me.

1861
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:50,020
I mean every,

1862
01:40:50,020 --> 01:40:54,070
the crazy thing about what's going on
the Internet now is every God damn day

1863
01:40:54,370 --> 01:40:58,430
you get Twitter messages and a
message board messages on my, my,

1864
01:40:58,660 --> 01:41:03,660
on the Rogan board where it's all these
new incredible scientific discoveries,

1865
01:41:04,060 --> 01:41:06,820
all these new weird things that
are happening around the world,

1866
01:41:06,821 --> 01:41:10,450
like the thousand butterflying thousands of
birds that have died and fallen from the

1867
01:41:10,451 --> 01:41:13,630
sky and Arkansas and everybody's going,
what the butterfly is going on?

1868
01:41:13,890 --> 01:41:17,140
You know and heard that's viral just
because they're filming angry birds right

1869
01:41:17,141 --> 01:41:21,940
now. What that says viral videos for
the angry birds movie. Are you serious?

1870
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,850
I think that that's, that's a
rumor that's going on, right?

1871
01:41:23,870 --> 01:41:27,640
There's no way you're going to
kill thousands. What happened?

1872
01:41:27,641 --> 01:41:30,450
They actually think what happened was
that's like the fireworks jail for

1873
01:41:30,460 --> 01:41:33,610
fireworks. 10 years actually roused
them from their sleep and they rent,

1874
01:41:33,611 --> 01:41:36,520
they couldn't see and ran
into like different chimneys
and everything. They just,

1875
01:41:36,580 --> 01:41:37,980
they get it, they stay, they flew.

1876
01:41:37,980 --> 01:41:40,540
Well that doesn't make sense because
there's thousands of them and they're over

1877
01:41:40,541 --> 01:41:43,800
fields and shit. The thousands of them
got scared and fell from the sky deck.

1878
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:46,720
That doesn't sound right.
It sounds like bird flu or something.

1879
01:41:46,721 --> 01:41:49,300
Maybe it sounds like they
butterflying poison them or something.

1880
01:41:49,330 --> 01:41:53,470
That sounds more like, yeah,
there's probably some, you
know, loud or something.

1881
01:41:53,471 --> 01:41:55,450
And there's the conspiracy theory angle.

1882
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:58,180
There's a bunch of people that are
trying to pawn it off on this one guy.

1883
01:41:58,390 --> 01:42:01,300
I should, I should know this man's name,
so I'm going to look it up right now.

1884
01:42:01,510 --> 01:42:05,090
But this guy just got killed and he was,
um,

1885
01:42:05,190 --> 01:42:10,190
a chemical weapons expert and he was
tortured and murdered and a real thing.

1886
01:42:10,660 --> 01:42:10,930
Yeah.

1887
01:42:10,930 --> 01:42:14,110
And they think there's some sort of a
connection to it that the guy turned up

1888
01:42:14,111 --> 01:42:17,880
missing. And, um, he
turned up missing and, uh,

1889
01:42:17,890 --> 01:42:22,790
I think in Delaware and they found them
in a landfill. He had been murdered. Yeah.

1890
01:42:22,810 --> 01:42:25,590
And they believe that this
guy, um, was, you know,

1891
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:30,430
here he is top you as
official. Yeah. He, um, it's,

1892
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:31,750
it's really kind of creepy,
man.

1893
01:42:31,860 --> 01:42:34,670
Their stories are very bizarre
because this guy was like, uh, he,

1894
01:42:34,840 --> 01:42:39,640
he worked under George Herbert Walker
Bush as well, and he's an expert in, um,

1895
01:42:40,180 --> 01:42:42,670
and um, um, uh,

1896
01:42:42,671 --> 01:42:46,810
weapons and biological weapons and
chemical weapons. It's crazy shit, man.

1897
01:42:47,410 --> 01:42:50,830
And, uh, the, the course of
conspiracy angle is that a,

1898
01:42:50,831 --> 01:42:53,420
they were testing something and killed
all these birds off and he might have

1899
01:42:53,421 --> 01:42:55,840
protested a freaked out
or, you know, I, I've been,

1900
01:42:56,140 --> 01:42:58,230
I spent a lot of time
reading the history and I,

1901
01:42:58,270 --> 01:43:01,810
one of the things I like about doing
that as opposed to even looking at where

1902
01:43:01,811 --> 01:43:05,530
we're headed is how, how
little, how much change,

1903
01:43:05,570 --> 01:43:09,580
but also how little changes a lot of ways.
And the man's name is John P.

1904
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:14,200
Wheeler for anybody who wants to look into
the story, John a Joe Chen, p wheeler,

1905
01:43:14,201 --> 01:43:17,710
w h e l, e r. And just
type that into Google.

1906
01:43:17,711 --> 01:43:20,260
And I'm sure a bunch of different
stories will come up on the sky.

1907
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:24,460
This is the same thing that somebody
printed to all the websites in with like I

1908
01:43:24,461 --> 01:43:28,360
s or anything.
Some of them are the ones that are legit,

1909
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:31,330
legit ones that aren't claiming
any sort of conspiracy.

1910
01:43:31,331 --> 01:43:34,030
Those are interesting because would
they talked about is the fact that this

1911
01:43:34,031 --> 01:43:37,120
guy's television was turned on full blast
and it freaked out his neighbors cause

1912
01:43:37,121 --> 01:43:39,070
he was a really kind of a quiet
guy and it was an older guy.

1913
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:42,940
They didn't understand why it's television
was ty co was like blasting like that.

1914
01:43:43,120 --> 01:43:46,480
Well television really loud is one of
the ways they hide the sounds of torture.

1915
01:43:47,170 --> 01:43:48,990
So they found this guy's house,
um,

1916
01:43:49,150 --> 01:43:52,390
and there was a yellow police tape in
his kitchen and they pulled up floor

1917
01:43:52,391 --> 01:43:54,290
boards and they roped off the chair.

1918
01:43:54,440 --> 01:43:57,860
So the idea is that it is very possible
that they might have talked to this guy

1919
01:43:57,861 --> 01:44:00,470
before the killed them and they might
have tortured him in his own house and

1920
01:44:00,471 --> 01:44:04,040
then they killed him and then it took him
to a dump. Yeah. It's, you know, it's,

1921
01:44:04,041 --> 01:44:08,060
it's interesting when a guy has that sort
of a backgrounds, you know, so, you know,

1922
01:44:08,061 --> 01:44:10,910
and like I said, I know, I'm not saying
by the conspiracy theory, I'm saying,

1923
01:44:10,911 --> 01:44:11,601
you know,
first of all,

1924
01:44:11,601 --> 01:44:15,260
it's creepy that this guy got butterflying
tortured and murdered or at least the very

1925
01:44:15,261 --> 01:44:18,440
least murdered the torture part. It's
speculation at this point, but it's a,

1926
01:44:18,441 --> 01:44:19,520
it's an interesting little thing.

1927
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:23,610
I don't know if it has anything to
do with all these, uh, this guy.

1928
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:27,140
You can pretty much connect anyone from
that store to that store if you really

1929
01:44:27,141 --> 01:44:31,820
had to type without not, we're just
guesswork. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Yeah.

1930
01:44:31,821 --> 01:44:33,770
Me Basically we were just
making pieces of fiction.

1931
01:44:33,771 --> 01:44:37,700
We don't really know if he's connected
to it, but the idea is oh two,

1932
01:44:37,710 --> 01:44:40,370
that's what I want to talk about.
In Abu Dhabi this year,

1933
01:44:40,371 --> 01:44:44,860
they made it rain 52 times. Did you
know that they made it round seating?

1934
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:48,270
Silver got like a strict payment doing,
they've been doing cloud seeding system.

1935
01:44:49,370 --> 01:44:52,430
They probably made it right in there more
than $52 and they've been doing cloud

1936
01:44:52,431 --> 01:44:54,080
seeding for many, many years. But this,

1937
01:44:54,081 --> 01:44:56,330
this is something that they've
come public about and that,

1938
01:44:56,331 --> 01:45:00,410
that Abu Dhabi better at using,
they're using it as a weekly strategy.

1939
01:45:00,830 --> 01:45:03,670
They're like, I mean, 52 times. That's
like once a week. Man, that's crazy.

1940
01:45:03,740 --> 01:45:06,710
If they just choose to space it out
like that, they want to make it greener.

1941
01:45:06,710 --> 01:45:08,560
They're very ambitious.
Yeah. How crazy is that?

1942
01:45:08,561 --> 01:45:10,550
They're happening where they're getting
the drawing in their water from.

1943
01:45:10,630 --> 01:45:13,370
It wasn't there before that apparently
there's moisture in the air and

1944
01:45:13,371 --> 01:45:14,670
especially where they live there,

1945
01:45:14,671 --> 01:45:18,170
they're near a lot of ocean and there's
moisture in the air and you have to coax

1946
01:45:18,171 --> 01:45:22,370
it out. But I mean, what are
the repercussions? What are
the repercussions of that?

1947
01:45:22,371 --> 01:45:27,080
I mean, what is the, I mean, how safe is
it to be spraying shit in the air? Well,

1948
01:45:27,081 --> 01:45:30,950
they've been doing it for many years. I
mean, they've always done cloud seeding.

1949
01:45:30,951 --> 01:45:33,710
I don't know how effective it is and I
don't know how good they've gotten on it.

1950
01:45:33,711 --> 01:45:36,980
But, um, I know that that's been around
for since at least the seventies.

1951
01:45:37,310 --> 01:45:38,780
I think they're getting better at it.
Yeah.

1952
01:45:39,310 --> 01:45:42,980
This Abu Dhabi thing was fascinating
because I've never heard it discussed on

1953
01:45:42,981 --> 01:45:46,820
like cnn.com or you know,
any major in major news website.

1954
01:45:46,820 --> 01:45:49,470
But that's what they were
talking about is very, is, is,

1955
01:45:49,471 --> 01:45:52,250
is I guess from what I've read
becoming really ambitious,

1956
01:45:52,251 --> 01:45:55,270
they really want to become sort
of the new Arab, that center of,

1957
01:45:55,271 --> 01:45:58,640
for the new Arab world. You know,
there's sort of the, the beacon of light,

1958
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:03,050
if you will, for a different way of
doing things. They got crazy paper, dude.

1959
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:06,950
They got crazy paper. They go crazy
paper. But, but live in like that man,

1960
01:46:06,951 --> 01:46:10,940
make an artificial butterflying rain showers.
Holy Shit. That's crazy. You know,

1961
01:46:10,941 --> 01:46:13,310
it's just, you always wonder,
does that, is it good?

1962
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:15,670
Is that going to affect
something somewhere else? Uh, is,

1963
01:46:15,700 --> 01:46:19,320
is forcing it to rain somewhere else
for saying like a butterflying hurricane to,

1964
01:46:19,550 --> 01:46:21,320
to grow over here on the other side.
I mean,

1965
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:24,080
isn't the sky all somehow
or another connected,

1966
01:46:24,081 --> 01:46:26,390
isn't the environment connecting
sell? I don't think that, no,

1967
01:46:26,391 --> 01:46:30,860
I don't think that a localized, you know,
rain seeding of cloud seeding. It's over.

1968
01:46:30,861 --> 01:46:35,630
How big of an area do you get away
with it? But that's the thing.

1969
01:46:35,631 --> 01:46:39,850
I don't think it's a, I don't think you
can do it over a large area and so on.

1970
01:46:39,860 --> 01:46:40,970
It's hard to do.
I think so.

1971
01:46:40,971 --> 01:46:43,820
I don't know if they figured out how to
do it all the time and obviously they

1972
01:46:43,821 --> 01:46:46,370
have, they've done it 52 times.
That's pretty consistent.

1973
01:46:46,640 --> 01:46:49,640
If they just decided to do that, that
would be such a trip. If Allston,

1974
01:46:49,690 --> 01:46:50,190
we went over

1975
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:52,950
to two, I would dominate. It was
like West Palm Beach, Florida.

1976
01:46:53,130 --> 01:46:56,910
It's butterflying dead and shit.
Everything's wedded. We're headed.

1977
01:46:56,911 --> 01:46:59,880
We are becoming more and more in control
of our environment or at least trying

1978
01:46:59,881 --> 01:47:02,580
to be. But then again, we're
also losing some control of it.

1979
01:47:02,581 --> 01:47:04,850
If you buy into the whole global warming,
you know,

1980
01:47:04,860 --> 01:47:09,000
that's the story of the Annunaki.
That's the story from the Sumerian text.

1981
01:47:09,030 --> 01:47:11,190
The reason why human beings were invented,
the whole,

1982
01:47:11,370 --> 01:47:13,890
the Zechariah sitch and craziness,
you know about all this.

1983
01:47:14,190 --> 01:47:19,190
The story was that these alien beings
from another planet came to earth because

1984
01:47:19,261 --> 01:47:23,360
they had ruined their atmosphere with
their technological race and so in,

1985
01:47:23,361 --> 01:47:27,330
in they ruin their atmosphere and they
needed gold particles to suspend in their

1986
01:47:27,331 --> 01:47:30,270
atmosphere to protect them from radiation.
And the sun's chill with that.

1987
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:31,433
That's pretty well.

1988
01:47:31,590 --> 01:47:36,300
And that they had done exactly what we're
about to do right now. And the, the, uh,

1989
01:47:36,330 --> 01:47:37,920
it's the most ridiculous thing ever.

1990
01:47:37,950 --> 01:47:40,500
It's called the 12th planet
and he wrote it back in 1970.

1991
01:47:40,501 --> 01:47:45,180
But what's fascinating is the idea of
suspending particles in the atmosphere

1992
01:47:45,181 --> 01:47:47,880
that had never been discussed
until like the year 2000.

1993
01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:50,540
And they had like a global
symposium on, on, you know,

1994
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:54,240
protecting the earth from environmental
hazards, like losing the ozone layer,

1995
01:47:54,241 --> 01:47:55,230
losing our atmosphere.

1996
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:58,890
And that was one of the suggestions
for suspend reflective particles in the

1997
01:47:58,891 --> 01:48:00,870
atmosphere. That's pretty wild.
Yeah. That you could do that.

1998
01:48:00,871 --> 01:48:04,740
You could fill the sky with
silver and gold particles. Well,

1999
01:48:04,741 --> 01:48:09,300
gold to the s the crazy thing about
gold is a tiny little piece of gold can

2000
01:48:09,301 --> 01:48:13,860
spread out so far. Gold dust is so
fine. It's like incredible moving.

2001
01:48:13,890 --> 01:48:18,570
The other issues that you're,
you're actually, they just
created bacteria strains,

2002
01:48:18,870 --> 01:48:21,400
um, from a computer. In other words, they,

2003
01:48:21,401 --> 01:48:24,660
they cross pollinated DNA
and created lifeforms,

2004
01:48:24,661 --> 01:48:28,140
bacteria farms that had never existed
on earth that it's called synthetic

2005
01:48:28,141 --> 01:48:30,330
biology. This guy, Craig
venter and his team,

2006
01:48:30,331 --> 01:48:33,510
if you go to ted.com you can see
his lecture and when when they,

2007
01:48:33,511 --> 01:48:35,400
for the first time on a printer,

2008
01:48:35,820 --> 01:48:40,820
they print it out essentially
the structure for a
completely new life form and,

2009
01:48:41,611 --> 01:48:46,611
and would that has far
reaching implications in
the sense that for the first

2010
01:48:47,221 --> 01:48:50,460
time human beings might very well be
able to control their own evolution and

2011
01:48:50,461 --> 01:48:55,461
certainly create new life forms are
going to be such a butterflying mess.

2012
01:48:56,220 --> 01:49:00,270
It's going to be create,
it comes with great promise,

2013
01:49:00,271 --> 01:49:02,280
but also peril manifesting in fire.

2014
01:49:07,310 --> 01:49:11,340
Yeah, no shit. With your paper
monster, what the butterfly you're doing?

2015
01:49:11,341 --> 01:49:15,150
You're going to make a new life forms
with your computer. How nuts is that butterfly,

2016
01:49:15,151 --> 01:49:17,910
things are getting weird.
I think it's going to get,

2017
01:49:17,940 --> 01:49:21,510
I think it's going to get to a point where
we won't really be able to figure out

2018
01:49:21,570 --> 01:49:25,080
like, you know, like I was thinking,
I'm reading this, you guys, if you ever,

2019
01:49:25,081 --> 01:49:29,150
if you ever just take, take three
months and do it in two months, it,

2020
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:32,790
I'm reading blood Meridian Cormac
McCarthy's a masterpiece. It's,

2021
01:49:32,791 --> 01:49:33,750
it's considered by,

2022
01:49:33,751 --> 01:49:36,870
when they reviewed it in 85 they said
this is one of the great feats of language

2023
01:49:36,871 --> 01:49:40,410
in the past 50 years. It's, it's the,
it's the, and it's about a novel.

2024
01:49:40,680 --> 01:49:44,400
It's a novel and it's about the sort of
the settling of the west and it follows

2025
01:49:44,401 --> 01:49:47,830
these, this track, this group of 19. So,

2026
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:52,510
um, um, men who are hunting
Indians, what's it called? Scouts.

2027
01:49:52,540 --> 01:49:54,250
It's a brutal book.
What's it called?

2028
01:49:54,370 --> 01:49:57,730
It's called Blood Meridian blood
and Maria and, and you know,

2029
01:49:57,731 --> 01:49:59,440
we all know what happened.
A lot of people may not,

2030
01:49:59,441 --> 01:50:01,540
but what happened to the native Americans,
and it's just,

2031
01:50:01,541 --> 01:50:04,660
it's the same old story of one group
comes in with guns and they basically

2032
01:50:04,661 --> 01:50:07,720
decimate, you know, not just what disease
but with bullets. And everything else.

2033
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:12,490
But um, God, I forgot what I was going
to say, but it was about, um, oh yeah.

2034
01:50:12,491 --> 01:50:16,270
What I was gonna say is that if you
look at what happened as they started

2035
01:50:16,271 --> 01:50:19,390
settling the west is that the,
the,

2036
01:50:19,510 --> 01:50:23,320
the Europeans were killing
not just all the buffalo,

2037
01:50:23,321 --> 01:50:24,970
they were killing all the
other animals as well.

2038
01:50:24,971 --> 01:50:27,580
They got really efficient at it
because this, they lay the railroad,

2039
01:50:27,581 --> 01:50:30,850
they would shoot buffalo and in the course
and then they would place the bodies

2040
01:50:30,851 --> 01:50:32,440
with strychnine.
Now why would you do that?

2041
01:50:32,441 --> 01:50:35,410
Because all the other animals with feed
on the buffalo and they would die with

2042
01:50:35,411 --> 01:50:36,340
stuff,
the strychnine.

2043
01:50:36,550 --> 01:50:40,540
So then you could scan them and send all
those pelts to Europe and to the east

2044
01:50:40,810 --> 01:50:44,800
and to the east coast and stuff, whether
it was big money. So in of course,

2045
01:50:44,801 --> 01:50:47,590
a 20 years,
probably 500 million animals died.

2046
01:50:47,591 --> 01:50:50,140
If you look at the old paintings
and pictures of the, of the,

2047
01:50:50,141 --> 01:50:54,460
of the Great Plains in
America, they looked like the
Serengeti and, and of course,

2048
01:50:54,461 --> 01:50:58,030
the 20 years, literally we killed all
the buffalo and so many other animals.

2049
01:50:58,031 --> 01:51:01,480
Not just the wolf that fed on the Buffalo,
we killed him, but everything else. And,

2050
01:51:01,481 --> 01:51:02,290
and um,

2051
01:51:02,290 --> 01:51:06,250
so what happened for a lot of the native
Americans was their entire mythology,

2052
01:51:06,280 --> 01:51:08,170
entire mythology there.

2053
01:51:08,171 --> 01:51:11,440
Religions were wrapped up with their
environment and the animals around them.

2054
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:13,660
And in 20 years they were all gone.

2055
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:17,800
Forget the fact that they were starved
to death. But they're, they're very,

2056
01:51:17,830 --> 01:51:20,170
they're very mythology.
They're very religion.

2057
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:25,240
What would the cornerstone to their
culture was eradicated and you really

2058
01:51:25,331 --> 01:51:27,160
wonder, you know, what,

2059
01:51:27,190 --> 01:51:31,420
what psychologically they were going
through as they saw this true holocaust

2060
01:51:31,421 --> 01:51:34,420
sorta unfold for them. You
know, it's in its historic,

2061
01:51:34,510 --> 01:51:37,390
when you think about right heel short
of a time period, that is right.

2062
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:38,313
And I always think,

2063
01:51:38,380 --> 01:51:41,650
are we going to come up with a certain
kind of technology that does the same to

2064
01:51:41,651 --> 01:51:44,410
us? That's the question. I mean nothing.

2065
01:51:44,411 --> 01:51:49,300
Nothing says that our culture and our
way of life and our even lives are

2066
01:51:49,301 --> 01:51:52,690
guaranteed by anything. I mean if you're
very religious, you believe it is.

2067
01:51:52,930 --> 01:51:56,980
But for people who tend to have more
of a scientific bent or have a, Oh,

2068
01:51:56,990 --> 01:52:00,220
take a real look at history, it's
very possible that, you know,

2069
01:52:00,460 --> 01:52:05,460
there are threats out there eventually
maybe of our own design that could render

2070
01:52:06,401 --> 01:52:09,310
us extinct or abs.
Yeah.

2071
01:52:09,550 --> 01:52:14,550
The idea is that light keeps going
in a direction of more complexity.

2072
01:52:15,010 --> 01:52:16,600
Things getting more and more complicated.

2073
01:52:16,601 --> 01:52:20,950
In the issue with the Indians was you're
dealing with, okay. American Indians,

2074
01:52:20,951 --> 01:52:24,640
native Americans, we're dealing with
people that were so butterflying crazy.

2075
01:52:24,820 --> 01:52:29,680
They were willing to get in boats and go
across the ocean and across the country

2076
01:52:29,681 --> 01:52:31,510
to a place to live. Yeah. You know,

2077
01:52:31,511 --> 01:52:34,990
and then just trek out on their own
to the middle of the butterflying country.

2078
01:52:34,991 --> 01:52:39,520
There's giant continent that was literally
filled with people that were living

2079
01:52:39,521 --> 01:52:43,390
like the rest, the rest of the world.
They were living like a much, much,

2080
01:52:43,391 --> 01:52:46,040
much more modern. I mean,
American Indians before that

2081
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:48,290
we did, before we had
introduced or the, the uh,

2082
01:52:48,330 --> 01:52:50,660
Spanish or other had introduced
horses to them. I mean,

2083
01:52:50,661 --> 01:52:55,340
they were like no manic tp living
Arrow shooting motherbutterflyers, you know.

2084
01:52:55,341 --> 01:52:56,600
I mean it was really crazy.

2085
01:52:56,601 --> 01:52:59,780
It's like they were living just like the
people that they find today in the the

2086
01:52:59,900 --> 01:53:02,420
Amazon rain forest,
there's still finding people like that.

2087
01:53:02,421 --> 01:53:06,370
Today they found a bunch of new
tribes. There's like, I got, I got,

2088
01:53:06,371 --> 01:53:07,400
I can't remember the number,

2089
01:53:07,490 --> 01:53:11,330
but they have this fascinating photo of
one that they found that's near the Peru

2090
01:53:11,331 --> 01:53:15,350
and Brazil border and their
skin is covered with ink.

2091
01:53:15,650 --> 01:53:19,490
They're covered with red ink and two of
them are red and one of them looks like

2092
01:53:19,540 --> 01:53:24,050
like a black color and they're just
covered with like this crazy war paint and

2093
01:53:24,051 --> 01:53:27,730
they're holding bows and they're
pointing arrows at the airplanes.

2094
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:30,560
The airplanes take pictures of them.
These are undiscovered,

2095
01:53:30,590 --> 01:53:34,550
untouched tribes that's are completely
isolated from the rest of the world.

2096
01:53:34,551 --> 01:53:37,310
It's wild. So that's really
what American Indians were like.

2097
01:53:37,311 --> 01:53:39,170
Native Americans were like,
and unfortunately,

2098
01:53:39,560 --> 01:53:42,040
whatever the butterfly humanity
is doing here on this planet,

2099
01:53:42,090 --> 01:53:45,680
what we're trying to do is be
more better, faster, bigger.

2100
01:53:45,681 --> 01:53:48,890
What the butterfly are you get out of my
way. More. Better, faster, bigger.

2101
01:53:48,950 --> 01:53:53,950
How about a butterflying metal box that rolls
on metal train tracks and it goes 300

2102
01:53:55,341 --> 01:53:57,680
butterflying miles an hour and it cuts
across the whole country. I mean,

2103
01:53:57,940 --> 01:54:00,080
we just more better, faster,
more, better, faster.

2104
01:54:00,260 --> 01:54:02,340
Live in teepees is just getting
in the way. It was like,

2105
01:54:02,420 --> 01:54:05,090
what are you talking about? Sacred
ground. Sacred ground. Sacred ground.

2106
01:54:05,091 --> 01:54:07,310
Mine says money. Okay, we got to kill
you. We're going to kill these people.

2107
01:54:07,311 --> 01:54:09,530
We gotta kill him. I got tell him we got
a calendar they want and not reasonable.

2108
01:54:09,570 --> 01:54:12,230
It's the same old story of
history is full of that stuff.

2109
01:54:12,280 --> 01:54:14,960
That history is full of one group that
comes into another group and says,

2110
01:54:14,970 --> 01:54:18,180
you guys are in the way, man. You got
to either leave or die. I mean, yeah,

2111
01:54:18,200 --> 01:54:20,690
it's absolutely wrong. I mean,
not no one has justifying it.

2112
01:54:20,691 --> 01:54:22,610
It's absolutely heinous.
It's absolutely disgusting,

2113
01:54:22,611 --> 01:54:26,570
but objectively stepping away from the
old whole idea of emotions and humanity

2114
01:54:26,571 --> 01:54:29,780
and people in genocide and all that stuff.
If you look at it as like, you know,

2115
01:54:29,781 --> 01:54:33,080
in a direction that humanities,
that's inevitable.

2116
01:54:33,310 --> 01:54:36,930
The point is the DA unimaginable
can happen to people. And,

2117
01:54:36,931 --> 01:54:40,790
and it happens to huge groups of people,
whether it's Russia,

2118
01:54:40,820 --> 01:54:45,610
the Russian Ukrainians in the 1930s,
under Stalin or the Jews under Hitler and,

2119
01:54:45,611 --> 01:54:49,790
and, and you know, in the, uh,
later thirties and up to 45,

2120
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,340
the unimaginable. The, the, the,

2121
01:54:52,350 --> 01:54:56,240
the unspeakable can happen
to millions of people.

2122
01:54:56,310 --> 01:54:59,840
Millions people can perish in a period
of make the argument people make the

2123
01:54:59,841 --> 01:55:02,810
argument. But that was then, and now the
age of information, the South Hospital.

2124
01:55:02,860 --> 01:55:06,200
Now look at the, we have not
changed that much human beings.

2125
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:08,840
The one difference I will
say about history, thank God,

2126
01:55:09,110 --> 01:55:13,190
is that it becomes harder for bad men to
get away with things for a long period

2127
01:55:13,191 --> 01:55:17,190
of time because there are a
lot of people watching and,

2128
01:55:17,200 --> 01:55:20,600
and that's a very good thing. You
know, you're always going to have,

2129
01:55:20,601 --> 01:55:22,730
if you have an incentive
structure that gives,

2130
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:27,880
there are always people in society who
are willing to do what others won't do.

2131
01:55:28,460 --> 01:55:32,300
And,
and those people always flourish in chaos.

2132
01:55:32,360 --> 01:55:35,750
They always flourish in war when
Russia fell apart. That's right.

2133
01:55:35,960 --> 01:55:38,670
It's the people that are willing
to do what others won't do that.

2134
01:55:38,671 --> 01:55:43,230
That always rise to the top in in a
situation where there's no rule of law and

2135
01:55:43,231 --> 01:55:44,064
Sandra,

2136
01:55:44,250 --> 01:55:47,040
that's the enemy and that's not good.
That's not good.

2137
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:49,710
That's why you have to fight
for representative government.

2138
01:55:49,711 --> 01:55:52,160
You have to fight for all the things
the founding fathers Taco talked about

2139
01:55:52,170 --> 01:55:56,790
because it keeps bad men in check and so
whenever you start blaming individuals,

2140
01:55:57,030 --> 01:56:00,700
it's like kind of blaming the way of
the world. We're always going to have.

2141
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:03,180
You're always going to have bad people.

2142
01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:06,690
You want a system that keeps
them somewhat neutered.

2143
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:10,370
That's very important and
people don't challenge.

2144
01:56:10,470 --> 01:56:13,430
People don't understand the the,
the logic of countries and met.

2145
01:56:13,431 --> 01:56:14,640
It's all stupid man.
It's all stupid.

2146
01:56:14,910 --> 01:56:19,380
I want to show you a video and the
video is the hodge on the mosque.

2147
01:56:19,410 --> 01:56:20,430
I know all about the hush,

2148
01:56:20,970 --> 01:56:25,290
the hodge on Mecca and watching all
those people mill around the post and go,

2149
01:56:25,291 --> 01:56:25,651
listen,

2150
01:56:25,651 --> 01:56:30,651
if it's just you and your scantly
connected group of friends and you,

2151
01:56:31,381 --> 01:56:34,380
you have some sort of a conflict with
a group that's as connected as these

2152
01:56:34,490 --> 01:56:35,720
motherbutterflyers,
you know,

2153
01:56:35,730 --> 01:56:38,460
they're willing to do a lot of crazy
shit and you're willing to die.

2154
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:40,800
There's something quite
beautiful about the hot, amazing.

2155
01:56:40,950 --> 01:56:42,920
And the Hodges is beautiful because in,
in,

2156
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:47,010
in the notion as you were two sheets
and whether you're a prince or a pauper,

2157
01:56:47,260 --> 01:56:49,380
you're in the same group.
You were a two sheets.

2158
01:56:49,381 --> 01:56:52,440
When you go on your pilgrimage to Mecca
and every Muslim has to do at once in

2159
01:56:52,441 --> 01:56:56,640
their life, at least you go, you go and
you, you fast from sunup to sundown.

2160
01:56:57,330 --> 01:56:59,910
And usually if you're strict, I don't
even think you're allowed to drink water,

2161
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:03,810
but the notion is we're all
equal under the eyes of God.

2162
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:06,810
So it's a very egalitarian movement.

2163
01:57:06,811 --> 01:57:09,150
So when they make their
pilgrimage to Mecca,

2164
01:57:09,480 --> 01:57:14,160
they were two sheets and they
are, they are, they are we in?

2165
01:57:14,220 --> 01:57:17,340
So you can be right next to some of these
worth $1 billion and you have nothing

2166
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:20,730
but under the eyes of God when you're
there, you guys are all the same.

2167
01:57:20,730 --> 01:57:23,250
You're all eating the same foods,
you're all behaving the same way.

2168
01:57:23,490 --> 01:57:26,430
And it was this notion that Muhammad
came up with was this notion that, look,

2169
01:57:26,550 --> 01:57:30,330
we need, you always have to
go and, and, and basically we,

2170
01:57:30,520 --> 01:57:35,490
there's got to be somewhat of a, a
communal, a communal pilgrimage, uh,

2171
01:57:35,491 --> 01:57:39,180
humbling pilgrimage to show each
other that we're all the same.

2172
01:57:39,210 --> 01:57:41,010
It was kind of a unifying thing,
movement,

2173
01:57:41,011 --> 01:57:44,580
very important and ritualistic
things like, absolutely. Absolutely.

2174
01:57:44,581 --> 01:57:46,260
What does that box supposed to represent?

2175
01:57:46,261 --> 01:57:50,370
The big square building that I believe
is where Muhammad was buried. Mohammed,

2176
01:57:50,371 --> 01:57:55,270
I believe it was born in Medina and he
died in Mecca and Medina and Mecca. And I,

2177
01:57:55,590 --> 01:57:58,860
I'm sorry if you're a Muslim and I'm
getting them mixed, uh, switched around.

2178
01:57:58,861 --> 01:58:01,260
But Medina and Mecca are the most,
um,

2179
01:58:01,350 --> 01:58:05,910
they are the most
religious places in Islam.

2180
01:58:05,911 --> 01:58:08,970
There are truly the most religious places.
Notice on when you pray,

2181
01:58:08,971 --> 01:58:12,960
you pray toward Mecca.
So when you go to hotels or things in,

2182
01:58:12,961 --> 01:58:14,750
in the Arab world,
Muslim world,

2183
01:58:14,751 --> 01:58:16,860
a lot of times they have
arrows pointing to Mecca.

2184
01:58:16,900 --> 01:58:21,390
Is there a lot of prep iPhone APP? So
he not there. There may very well be.

2185
01:58:21,391 --> 01:58:22,560
I'd be surprised that there was,

2186
01:58:23,130 --> 01:58:27,240
there has to be [inaudible] if
there's not out there developers,

2187
01:58:27,241 --> 01:58:30,300
you know what the butterfly to do? You need to
make a mecca iPhone APP. I need to know.

2188
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:34,680
I'll pay my respects towards
sparco butterfly listen. So he was,

2189
01:58:34,740 --> 01:58:38,250
he was buried there. Yes.
That's incredible. So He's
under that box somewhere.

2190
01:58:38,251 --> 01:58:42,040
His right. I believe that's, I believe
that's the stone he was, he was the,

2191
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,950
I believe, and I just read about this
and I'm sorry that I don't know it,

2192
01:58:44,951 --> 01:58:49,951
but I believe that the stone was where
Mohammed received a message from sort of

2193
01:58:51,881 --> 01:58:53,770
an angel about the Koran.

2194
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:56,800
Because remember that the Muslims always
believed that there was one person that

2195
01:58:56,801 --> 01:58:58,500
spoke through God and that was Muhammad.

2196
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:02,290
And their proof was that he was an
illiterate shepard who over the course of

2197
01:59:02,291 --> 01:59:07,210
seven years wrote, the Suna wrote,
wrote essentially the, the Quran.

2198
01:59:07,870 --> 01:59:10,740
The Quran being a essentially
a bunch of poems. It's,

2199
01:59:10,741 --> 01:59:14,440
it's written in verse and it's quite
beautiful. It's quite, it's a, it's very,

2200
01:59:14,441 --> 01:59:18,310
very intricate and with these incredible
and stories and stuff, and they said,

2201
01:59:18,311 --> 01:59:21,280
how could one man write all this
in seven years? He was inspired.

2202
01:59:21,281 --> 01:59:22,780
He never learned how to write,
read or write,

2203
01:59:22,820 --> 01:59:26,050
but he would obviously had some kind
of a revelation or an inspiration.

2204
01:59:26,350 --> 01:59:30,370
And so that was what that was where
Muhammad really made his name.

2205
01:59:30,371 --> 01:59:34,390
And not only did he do that, but mom
had also was the guy who said, look,

2206
01:59:34,600 --> 01:59:37,750
this is a bunch of tribes, a bunch
of Pagan tribes. I'm going to,

2207
01:59:37,751 --> 01:59:41,890
I'm going to unite the people of Saudi
Arabia. I'm going to unite these people,

2208
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:42,611
these nomads.

2209
01:59:42,611 --> 01:59:45,610
I'm going to stop them from fighting
each other and I'm going to create one

2210
01:59:45,611 --> 01:59:49,750
group of people under one banner
of heaven. And that was the notion.

2211
01:59:50,730 --> 01:59:54,630
It's amazing how butterflying radical they
are to the gotten to the point where you

2212
01:59:54,631 --> 01:59:57,020
can't even draw Muhammad or,
yeah,

2213
01:59:57,250 --> 01:59:58,210
it's a shame.

2214
01:59:58,270 --> 02:00:01,660
It's a shame because historically Islam
was actually always a religion that was

2215
02:00:01,661 --> 02:00:05,530
so open to interpretation and in fact
we look, look, look at Indonesia,

2216
02:00:05,560 --> 02:00:10,120
Indonesia for until very recently and
even still was always, it's always,

2217
02:00:10,121 --> 02:00:14,830
it's been a Muslim country for many, many,
many years and has always been a very,

2218
02:00:14,831 --> 02:00:17,350
very open and tolerant society.

2219
02:00:17,351 --> 02:00:21,760
Remember that the Jews who were persecuted
and killed by the Christians always

2220
02:00:21,761 --> 02:00:23,890
went to Muslim countries first.

2221
02:00:24,130 --> 02:00:27,670
Muslims were the ones that
actually protected the Jews
because they were people

2222
02:00:27,671 --> 02:00:28,504
of the book.

2223
02:00:28,570 --> 02:00:33,570
The Quran upholds every story in the
Old Testament and believes that the Old

2224
02:00:33,730 --> 02:00:34,660
Testament to be gospel.

2225
02:00:34,810 --> 02:00:38,200
It's more of a rebuttal to
the new testament with the
notion that Jesus Christ,

2226
02:00:38,230 --> 02:00:40,240
that it considers to be a great prophet.

2227
02:00:40,540 --> 02:00:43,540
The notion that Christians say that Jesus
Christ is actually God is where they

2228
02:00:43,541 --> 02:00:45,940
take issue,
and that was where the big rift was.

2229
02:00:46,120 --> 02:00:50,650
But remember that Islam was always a place
for the most part, Islamic countries,

2230
02:00:50,651 --> 02:00:55,630
like the Ottoman empire was a place
where where the Jews took refuge in.

2231
02:00:55,631 --> 02:00:59,410
So that's why this, this, this
rift between Jews and Muslims.

2232
02:00:59,411 --> 02:01:03,400
Over the founding of the state of Israel
in 1948 that's where all of this came

2233
02:01:03,401 --> 02:01:05,900
from. And that's what's so
unfortunate about all that. Well,

2234
02:01:05,900 --> 02:01:07,320
at one point in time, the, the,

2235
02:01:07,321 --> 02:01:11,090
the Muslim religion or Muslim people
responsible for an incredible amount of

2236
02:01:11,091 --> 02:01:12,740
adventures to absolutely.

2237
02:01:12,741 --> 02:01:15,700
We'll look and say it's the omen
scientifically advanced. I mean,

2238
02:01:15,710 --> 02:01:17,580
you're talking about the
Ottoman Empire for God's sake.

2239
02:01:17,630 --> 02:01:21,350
It wasn't what it is today
and what happened that, that,

2240
02:01:21,380 --> 02:01:24,530
that butterflyed everything up and got it
to the point where it is today where

2241
02:01:24,531 --> 02:01:27,570
there's so much, you know, it's like
so many things degrade, you know, and,

2242
02:01:27,571 --> 02:01:31,370
and get to a point where it's not
what, you know, I would argue,

2243
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:34,910
I would argue that, and I'm
not a political scientist
and I don't know anything.

2244
02:01:34,911 --> 02:01:36,800
I'm just a goddamn actor, but, but I,

2245
02:01:36,801 --> 02:01:39,860
but I did live there for eight
years of my life and I would that

2246
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:44,810
the Middle East biggest problem
is not it. I think, I think,

2247
02:01:44,870 --> 02:01:47,630
I believe that Islamic fundamentalism was,

2248
02:01:47,660 --> 02:01:50,900
came out of the fact that the 22
governments in the Middle East are not

2249
02:01:50,901 --> 02:01:51,890
democracies,

2250
02:01:52,010 --> 02:01:56,420
that they've always been monarchies and
dictatorships and those monarchies and

2251
02:01:56,421 --> 02:01:59,540
dictatorships kept people in poverty.

2252
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:03,980
When you keep people in poverty and you
have a bunch of men that have no jobs

2253
02:02:03,981 --> 02:02:06,200
and nothing to make themselves
feel good about themselves,

2254
02:02:06,350 --> 02:02:07,970
they're going to turn to something man,

2255
02:02:08,150 --> 02:02:11,030
and they're going to turn to something
like a religion because it makes them,

2256
02:02:11,031 --> 02:02:14,480
and they're going to, and, and men do this
kind of thing. They'd say, Hey, again,

2257
02:02:14,510 --> 02:02:17,510
we have historical evidence for
that where people say, look,

2258
02:02:17,511 --> 02:02:20,060
there are Christian fundamentalists.
They're Jewish fundamentalists. You can,

2259
02:02:20,090 --> 02:02:24,560
you can, you, they're all over the place.
But, but, uh, somehow along the way,

2260
02:02:24,830 --> 02:02:28,340
uh, this became a perverted
notion of Islam where, you know,

2261
02:02:28,341 --> 02:02:31,430
I'm going to solve my problems with
violence. I'm going to blow myself up.

2262
02:02:31,500 --> 02:02:32,333
I'm going to go to heaven.

2263
02:02:32,660 --> 02:02:37,310
This is all very new man and I
and and religious fundamentalism.

2264
02:02:37,311 --> 02:02:40,490
It's fairly new. It's, it's a, it's
a 20th century invention. I've heard

2265
02:02:40,710 --> 02:02:42,510
a lot of people,
and I don't know if this is accurate,

2266
02:02:42,511 --> 02:02:45,330
but I've heard it from more than one
source where people were connecting the

2267
02:02:45,331 --> 02:02:49,710
mujahideen and their fight against the
Soviet Union and their work with the CIA

2268
02:02:49,711 --> 02:02:51,120
creating a bunch of,

2269
02:02:51,180 --> 02:02:54,910
a bunch of different new things that
happened in the Muslim religion, like,

2270
02:02:55,110 --> 02:02:56,510
like suicide bombers and

2271
02:02:56,740 --> 02:03:00,280
the suicide bombers actually notion of
jihad really because the suicide bombers,

2272
02:03:00,281 --> 02:03:03,100
where did they were the first suicide
bombers we were reading about it worthy.

2273
02:03:03,130 --> 02:03:07,120
Tommy. All Tigers actually in Sri
Lanka. They, that's who those were.

2274
02:03:07,550 --> 02:03:10,240
That was in the 90s, the early
nineties. I mean the Tamil Tigers,

2275
02:03:10,241 --> 02:03:12,940
where were the ones that were actually
blowing themselves up and nobody had ever

2276
02:03:12,941 --> 02:03:15,970
heard of that? We couldn't believe it. You
didn't, you'd never heard of any Muslim?

2277
02:03:17,220 --> 02:03:21,550
Absolutely not. Absolutely not. And
what are they? The Sri Lanka guys,

2278
02:03:21,551 --> 02:03:23,770
are they Muslims? What are
the, uh, the Tamil Tigers,

2279
02:03:23,771 --> 02:03:26,210
I believe a lot of them are Hindu in fact,
and now it's not.

2280
02:03:26,320 --> 02:03:30,680
Hindus were the first suicide
bombing. Yeah. So they were
not, they were not, uh, um,

2281
02:03:30,850 --> 02:03:34,370
Muslims 90 and the,
and,

2282
02:03:34,380 --> 02:03:37,490
and the Tamil Tigers were,
were fierce group of people trying.

2283
02:03:37,530 --> 02:03:40,690
They've been crushed, but they,
they, uh, uh, they were trying,

2284
02:03:40,720 --> 02:03:43,540
they were trying to fight for their own
independence, their own notion of, of,

2285
02:03:43,541 --> 02:03:46,840
you know, what they want. But,
um, so, so a lot of this stuff,

2286
02:03:46,841 --> 02:03:51,040
if you look at the inspiration behind
it, it's, it's pretty bizarre. You know,

2287
02:03:51,070 --> 02:03:56,030
groups watch other groups and you know,
what's the crazy bad ass,

2288
02:03:56,480 --> 02:03:59,940
you know, listen, I mean, suicide
bombing is not in Vietnam.

2289
02:03:59,941 --> 02:04:01,930
And you had people who
would, a lot of, like,

2290
02:04:01,931 --> 02:04:04,900
women would take your hand grenade
and jumping into a helicopter and blow

2291
02:04:04,901 --> 02:04:08,740
themselves up and everybody in the
helicopter. So that's just a human thing.

2292
02:04:08,741 --> 02:04:13,360
I mean, yes. Yes. So, um, there
were a lot of cases of that.

2293
02:04:13,420 --> 02:04:14,220
A lot of kids.

2294
02:04:14,220 --> 02:04:17,320
The Viet Cong were a tough group of
people who were willing to do whatever it

2295
02:04:17,321 --> 02:04:18,730
took to get to hard to tell

2296
02:04:18,970 --> 02:04:22,000
occupied, like, that must be
so crazy. It is. You know,

2297
02:04:22,001 --> 02:04:26,020
you're just a normal person living your
life in a hut somewhere and chillin and

2298
02:04:26,310 --> 02:04:27,131
I'm going a good time.

2299
02:04:27,131 --> 02:04:30,160
Then all of a sudden they're soldiers
coming in and metal boxes for some reason

2300
02:04:30,180 --> 02:04:32,800
you don't understand.
They're pointing guns at you and scream,

2301
02:04:32,990 --> 02:04:36,250
aren't you? It's like Afghanistan,
man. The Mujahideen was, you know, the,

2302
02:04:36,260 --> 02:04:37,680
the good example because

2303
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:41,230
they were basically when the Soviets
came in, first of all, Afghanistan,

2304
02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:42,660
it's never been a country.
You've got to understand,

2305
02:04:42,661 --> 02:04:45,360
it's always been a group of tribes. You
had to put, you had the push stones,

2306
02:04:45,540 --> 02:04:46,560
you have the techniques,

2307
02:04:46,710 --> 02:04:50,610
you have the Hazera and they
all have always competed
against each other. I mean,

2308
02:04:50,611 --> 02:04:54,060
where did you live when you were there?
I lived in Saudi Arabia and Lebanon, uh,

2309
02:04:54,061 --> 02:04:57,720
in the Arab world. But no, no.

2310
02:04:58,410 --> 02:05:02,130
But my mother had been there twice and my
father had been there twice. I thought,

2311
02:05:02,131 --> 02:05:04,050
I'm sorry. I thought you were saying
you lived in. No, I've been to,

2312
02:05:04,051 --> 02:05:08,400
it was kind of like you do, you did.
Oh, it's doing stand. Yeah. Yeah.

2313
02:05:08,430 --> 02:05:10,900
But that doesn't mean it. Now when
you're living in these, these, um,

2314
02:05:11,250 --> 02:05:13,860
how many countries did you live in?
I was born in the Philippines.

2315
02:05:13,861 --> 02:05:18,090
I then moved to India where I live in
Bombay and Calcutta, which is now Mumbai,

2316
02:05:18,091 --> 02:05:18,600
Bombay.

2317
02:05:18,600 --> 02:05:23,600
And then I moved to Lebanon and then I
moved to Pakistan and then I moved back

2318
02:05:24,811 --> 02:05:26,640
to Lebanon work.
It would be so in love with it now.

2319
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:30,430
How do you think I get so much? I get
laid then. I thought you were married. Oh,

2320
02:05:30,440 --> 02:05:34,770
sorry. Yeah. And uh, I forgot
about that part, but um, but
then I, then I moved to, uh,

2321
02:05:34,850 --> 02:05:37,620
uh, Lebanon again in the war broke out
and we got stuck in the war and I lived in

2322
02:05:37,621 --> 02:05:39,750
the heart of the end for six months.
Holy Shit.

2323
02:05:40,110 --> 02:05:42,410
We really couldn't get out of the country.
Oh my God.

2324
02:05:42,420 --> 02:05:45,360
I used to hear machine gun and it was
crazy. You know what you're worried about?

2325
02:05:45,361 --> 02:05:48,240
The holiday and getting overtaken was
too young to worry about that stuff.

2326
02:05:48,241 --> 02:05:52,080
You know, I was, um, gosh,
I was a, I think 11 or 12,

2327
02:05:52,620 --> 02:05:57,150
and then I was, we were evacuated to
Greece and I lived in Greece and then I,

2328
02:05:57,151 --> 02:06:01,790
and then I went to Saudi Arabia. And then
when, by the time I was 14, I'd, I'd,

2329
02:06:02,080 --> 02:06:05,260
I'd never lived in the states and I came
to the states. That's incredible. Yeah.

2330
02:06:05,490 --> 02:06:06,630
Yeah.
It was pretty wild.

2331
02:06:07,310 --> 02:06:10,980
We had a very different perspective
growing up and no Shit, Huh? Yeah.

2332
02:06:10,981 --> 02:06:14,840
And the world and the world, uh, and,
and what happens to the world, um,

2333
02:06:15,480 --> 02:06:20,160
makes a difference to you, you know,
like this, this Pakistanian governor,

2334
02:06:20,220 --> 02:06:20,550
you know,

2335
02:06:20,550 --> 02:06:25,550
in Pakistan there's called the blasphemy
law and the law is if you insult Islam,

2336
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:29,670
you will be put to death.
Now when you say insult Islam,

2337
02:06:29,730 --> 02:06:32,640
there are a lot of ways to
interpret that and people use it,

2338
02:06:32,641 --> 02:06:35,810
manipulate it to get rid of their
neighbors and things like that. And this,

2339
02:06:35,811 --> 02:06:39,030
this governor of the
Punjab, which is, um, uh,

2340
02:06:39,031 --> 02:06:43,440
an area of a large area of
Pakistan basically said, um,

2341
02:06:43,500 --> 02:06:46,320
I'm sorry if it's putting, I don't know,
it's Punjab. I thought that was India,

2342
02:06:46,321 --> 02:06:50,160
but anyway, but he was a big oven and he
said, um, he was trying to get rid of it.

2343
02:06:50,161 --> 02:06:51,690
You've tried to repeal it.
It was trying to, you know,

2344
02:06:51,691 --> 02:06:54,990
he was a champion of women's rights and
things like that and I sort of a face of

2345
02:06:54,991 --> 02:06:57,480
the more modern notion of,
you know,

2346
02:06:57,481 --> 02:07:02,110
not only Islam but with Pakistan
and uh, he was assassinated. Uh,

2347
02:07:02,220 --> 02:07:05,400
one of his elite guards filled in with
23 bullets because this recent, yeah,

2348
02:07:05,430 --> 02:07:08,310
really recently, very recently, I just
thought to myself, I thought, man,

2349
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:10,620
this stuff is not dead.

2350
02:07:10,650 --> 02:07:14,910
We still are in living in a world of
ignorance and of people who are willing to

2351
02:07:14,911 --> 02:07:16,740
solve problems through violence.

2352
02:07:16,741 --> 02:07:20,940
How about this crazy motherbutterflyer in
North Korea? Man, oh, Kim Jong, Il,

2353
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:23,760
he's the biggest day holding the
history of the world. However,

2354
02:07:23,970 --> 02:07:26,790
he wins biggest asshole of all time.
He's just a dick.

2355
02:07:27,030 --> 02:07:31,380
The crazy thing about the Koreans is
that North Korea and South Korea war with

2356
02:07:31,381 --> 02:07:35,110
each other basically, and they looked
exactly the same. It's crazy shit.

2357
02:07:35,160 --> 02:07:39,730
So bizarre. You're talking about
it. That's a monarchy. North Korea,

2358
02:07:39,731 --> 02:07:40,564
that's a forum.

2359
02:07:40,610 --> 02:07:44,400
They yawned while 2 million
of their people starve to
death in the 90s they just

2360
02:07:44,401 --> 02:07:48,910
did. The elite was like pass the
salt. That's amazing. There's just no,

2361
02:07:49,030 --> 02:07:52,330
no power to revolt. And there's
a massive amount of patriotism.

2362
02:07:52,610 --> 02:07:54,490
It's not just patriotism,
it's a religion.

2363
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:58,990
I mean the North Koreans believe
that the dear leader is a deity man.

2364
02:07:59,470 --> 02:08:02,860
They've done a good job of getting that.
Isn't that the same in Thailand?

2365
02:08:02,930 --> 02:08:05,650
They'll have a know Thailand
is actually amazing. Yes.

2366
02:08:05,651 --> 02:08:10,420
Thailand's king has s there's this,
he has a sort of, he's a semi deity.

2367
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:14,680
But what's really amazing about Thailand
is that they've never been colonized

2368
02:08:14,970 --> 02:08:17,740
and, and it's because they've always
been really good at compromising.

2369
02:08:17,740 --> 02:08:20,980
They've always kind of been really good
at figuring out a way to kind of just be

2370
02:08:20,981 --> 02:08:24,300
the place where you come from. A
little R and r butterfly war man. That's,

2371
02:08:24,301 --> 02:08:27,820
that's in Laos. And Cambodia
and Vietnam, US, Eh,

2372
02:08:27,970 --> 02:08:31,730
we'll just align ourselves with the
u s cause it's easier and you know,

2373
02:08:31,731 --> 02:08:33,520
you can come over and have a good time.

2374
02:08:33,521 --> 02:08:36,910
And we got pretty girls and they're
just a really sweet people. Man.

2375
02:08:36,911 --> 02:08:41,410
It's amazing to have such a bad
ass fighting style. You know,

2376
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:44,440
most people believe the best
standup fighting style in the world.

2377
02:08:44,510 --> 02:08:47,450
Moitai maybe man, they're
just, uh, they're there for,

2378
02:08:47,451 --> 02:08:52,451
for a group of people that are so butterflying
nice to you and so welcoming and it's

2379
02:08:52,991 --> 02:08:56,200
such a safe place, man. You walk
around, you never worry. You know, I,

2380
02:08:56,201 --> 02:08:59,360
you just drive around and
you're like, there's no crime.
You never worry about it.

2381
02:08:59,390 --> 02:09:02,620
Just a lot of really pretty girls that
you can, you know, date if you want.

2382
02:09:02,621 --> 02:09:07,000
But you know, you're in that. But I'm a,
I'm an actor guys, so just say, you know,

2383
02:09:07,001 --> 02:09:11,200
I was always doing my scenes.
Did you practice Tai while
you're there? Yes, I did.

2384
02:09:11,220 --> 02:09:11,950
One thing I wanted to do

2385
02:09:11,950 --> 02:09:14,560
do is go to a Paquette and a,

2386
02:09:14,561 --> 02:09:16,960
there's a tiger Moitai thing and do like,

2387
02:09:16,990 --> 02:09:19,810
I just don't know if it's safe enough
to bring my whole family down there.

2388
02:09:20,980 --> 02:09:22,040
I check here it is.

2389
02:09:22,300 --> 02:09:26,060
I know a lot of western nurse who
lived down there who loved it. Yeah.

2390
02:09:26,061 --> 02:09:28,460
It just seems very trippy risk.
I just want to do it so good to me.

2391
02:09:28,461 --> 02:09:29,660
Everything's a risk.
And I think it'd be,

2392
02:09:29,810 --> 02:09:32,980
it'd be amazing for your kids to see
a different part of the world. Yeah.

2393
02:09:33,020 --> 02:09:36,800
Murder and shit. Six flags. It's
pretty scary to some wild monkeys.

2394
02:09:37,240 --> 02:09:38,090
I think the US is way,

2395
02:09:38,091 --> 02:09:43,091
way more dangerous in some ways and a
lot of countries to visit and stuff like

2396
02:09:43,191 --> 02:09:44,024
that.

2397
02:09:44,330 --> 02:09:47,570
Tell me that about, um, uh, I was
talking about going to Mexico,

2398
02:09:47,690 --> 02:09:51,320
like they were going to Mexico on Cabo
San Lucas or one of those places and I

2399
02:09:51,321 --> 02:09:55,070
was like, uh, yeah, but I
mean, butterfly man, don't you worry
about, oh, Puerto Vallarta.

2400
02:09:55,220 --> 02:09:55,521
I was like,

2401
02:09:55,521 --> 02:09:58,670
you don't worry about like
all the violence that's
going on in Mexico. They go,

2402
02:09:58,671 --> 02:10:01,220
well, you know, there's violence in
America to, you know, go to Detroit,

2403
02:10:01,221 --> 02:10:04,100
you probably won't get caught up
in it. I'm like, yeah, okay, maybe,

2404
02:10:04,580 --> 02:10:08,360
but I know where Detroit is also those
drug cartels from what I hear are

2405
02:10:08,361 --> 02:10:10,660
actually starting to target tourists.
Like yeah,

2406
02:10:11,640 --> 02:10:16,290
they're starting to target tourist areas
because they're trying to get resorts

2407
02:10:16,291 --> 02:10:19,620
to pay them off because they extort
money from a bunch of different ways.

2408
02:10:19,800 --> 02:10:22,210
One of the things they do is kidnapped
people that are trying to uh,

2409
02:10:22,290 --> 02:10:24,900
get to America and then
they go back to the,

2410
02:10:25,050 --> 02:10:29,930
they killed a lot of people from
Guatemala and El Salvador. They just,

2411
02:10:29,940 --> 02:10:32,520
and these people were just people that
were trying to migrate to America.

2412
02:10:32,700 --> 02:10:34,220
Well they asked for money I guess,
and I said

2413
02:10:34,220 --> 02:10:36,500
no, and they just don't ask for a lot of
money and they said we're going to kill

2414
02:10:36,501 --> 02:10:38,090
them.
And they do it all the time.

2415
02:10:38,091 --> 02:10:40,610
And apparently some people pay and some
people don't. And the people that pay,

2416
02:10:40,611 --> 02:10:43,790
they get that money and they let the
people free would they kill a bunch of

2417
02:10:43,791 --> 02:10:45,800
butterflying people? Man, it's
really, really scary.

2418
02:10:45,801 --> 02:10:50,801
So bad and you see the videos of these
12 year old kids that they've hired for

2419
02:10:50,871 --> 02:10:54,120
assassins and the, you know,
they've completely butterfly these
kids heads. Really? Yeah.

2420
02:10:54,260 --> 02:10:55,490
And some of them were American kids.

2421
02:10:55,491 --> 02:10:58,790
They've hired the drug cartels have hard
and one of them got arrested recently

2422
02:10:58,791 --> 02:11:02,390
and you know the cell phone video footage
of him torturing people and it got

2423
02:11:02,391 --> 02:11:03,340
onto the internet.
It's,

2424
02:11:03,341 --> 02:11:06,350
it's horrendous stuff in and they
tortured people before they killed them,

2425
02:11:06,980 --> 02:11:11,370
you know, and this 12 year old kid
and you know, I mean they still evil,

2426
02:11:11,420 --> 02:11:13,520
they're taking violence
to a whole new level.

2427
02:11:13,610 --> 02:11:16,070
If you look at like what's going on
in the world and all this, you know,

2428
02:11:16,071 --> 02:11:19,190
the idea that we're over in Afghanistan
so that we don't have to fight it over

2429
02:11:19,191 --> 02:11:22,040
here. Hey, how about what
is right connected to us?

2430
02:11:22,041 --> 02:11:26,480
How about some shit you can drive to take
as Mexico you can butterflying drive to and

2431
02:11:26,481 --> 02:11:28,100
that puny ass butterflying wall,

2432
02:11:28,190 --> 02:11:30,480
that's really not going to stop
anybody from coming over to races.

2433
02:11:30,730 --> 02:11:34,310
But bigger question is, would you legalize
drugs? And doesn't that make sense?

2434
02:11:34,630 --> 02:11:38,360
The only problem is it's gotten to a
certain point where I think you have to

2435
02:11:38,361 --> 02:11:41,360
squash the problem before you
legalize drugs because the,

2436
02:11:41,361 --> 02:11:45,040
the cartels are so butterflying big. You
have to somehow, and it's working,

2437
02:11:45,540 --> 02:11:47,840
they're not doing it. So it's
a war. It's gotta be a war.

2438
02:11:48,140 --> 02:11:51,710
The drug cartels are gigantic
now, man, look, what do I know?

2439
02:11:51,710 --> 02:11:52,700
I'm talking out of my ass.

2440
02:11:52,910 --> 02:11:57,070
But the whole situation came about
for sure because drugs aren't leaving.

2441
02:11:57,260 --> 02:12:01,400
The problem with it being a war is that
the drug cartels are very much in sync

2442
02:12:01,401 --> 02:12:03,900
with the power structure with
the government itself. Sure.

2443
02:12:03,950 --> 02:12:08,300
It's all in the self apparently is a lot
of the kind of Mexican company itself

2444
02:12:08,301 --> 02:12:11,570
is propped up by the drug trade.
So holy. So if that's the case,

2445
02:12:11,571 --> 02:12:15,350
then how do you de legitimize, how'd
you figure out a way to make it work?

2446
02:12:15,351 --> 02:12:18,640
Do you legalize they're talking about
legalizing drugs in Mexico itself.

2447
02:12:18,890 --> 02:12:22,730
We criminalized everything in
Mexico. LSD, mushrooms. Oh yeah.

2448
02:12:22,850 --> 02:12:24,770
I mean knew you're not supposed
to sell it, but if you have it,

2449
02:12:24,771 --> 02:12:26,780
you don't go to jail.
As long as there's a demand.

2450
02:12:26,900 --> 02:12:29,720
And the risk of pedaling
that demand is that high.

2451
02:12:29,721 --> 02:12:32,750
You're going to have people who are bad
ass motherbutterflyers wanting to do whatever

2452
02:12:32,751 --> 02:12:34,770
it takes to get that money.
Scary.

2453
02:12:34,910 --> 02:12:37,160
I mean it's every role should have
learned about that in this country with

2454
02:12:37,161 --> 02:12:38,980
prohibition 1920s I,
you know,

2455
02:12:39,020 --> 02:12:42,890
we're lucky that marijuana has the
calming effect that it has because if it,

2456
02:12:43,160 --> 02:12:46,070
if it wasn't, you know, the whole
stoner culture and around behind it,

2457
02:12:46,071 --> 02:12:47,690
if that's why.
That's why I've always been,

2458
02:12:47,720 --> 02:12:51,380
I've just marveled at the fact that you
made alcohol, legal and weed illegal,

2459
02:12:51,430 --> 02:12:54,330
that it's like goes back to that reefer
madness ignorance. It's like, you know,

2460
02:12:54,340 --> 02:12:55,360
you're out of your butterflying bull.

2461
02:12:55,370 --> 02:12:58,610
It's also an issue of it's
been illegal for so long.

2462
02:12:58,640 --> 02:13:01,550
If they'd come out and say there's no
reason for it to have ever been illegal

2463
02:13:01,551 --> 02:13:02,270
now,

2464
02:13:02,270 --> 02:13:06,830
then you open up a whole can of worms
that just brought up the biggest and best

2465
02:13:06,831 --> 02:13:09,620
argument for any, for,
for a smaller government.

2466
02:13:09,650 --> 02:13:14,090
Whenever you pass a law, and I'm not
saying some laws don't need to be passed,

2467
02:13:14,091 --> 02:13:17,330
but you gotta remember one thing,
you pass any kind of law,

2468
02:13:17,570 --> 02:13:21,530
any kind of legislation, say what you
want about the Obama health care thing.

2469
02:13:21,560 --> 02:13:23,720
I don't know enough about it.
I'm not going to make a stand on it,

2470
02:13:23,900 --> 02:13:28,670
but just know that when you have a huge
government program and you pass laws

2471
02:13:28,671 --> 02:13:29,570
around that program,

2472
02:13:29,571 --> 02:13:34,571
what happens is a cottage industry grows
up around that law and a lot of people

2473
02:13:35,971 --> 02:13:40,890
develop an interest in economic
interest. Again, keeping that law act of,

2474
02:13:40,891 --> 02:13:43,790
that's why whenever you start
a government program, when it,

2475
02:13:43,800 --> 02:13:48,300
you started giving money to somebody or
whatever it might be, it doesn't go away.

2476
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:53,340
And the Democrats themselves had passed
just something because it will never go

2477
02:13:53,341 --> 02:13:57,510
away and you'll be able to add
to it and, and that's, that is,

2478
02:13:57,511 --> 02:13:59,190
it's not about being right or left.
It's,

2479
02:13:59,220 --> 02:14:02,610
you better keep that in mind because
George Washington himself said,

2480
02:14:02,720 --> 02:14:06,660
men will invent laws to take their
own freedom away from themselves.

2481
02:14:06,900 --> 02:14:08,730
That's how people are,
you know,

2482
02:14:08,731 --> 02:14:10,710
you want to make the world
a really butterflying safe place.

2483
02:14:10,710 --> 02:14:13,380
You want to legislate everything. I don't
want to live in a country like that.

2484
02:14:13,410 --> 02:14:16,470
Fuck you. I want to take my own
personal responsibility for things.

2485
02:14:16,500 --> 02:14:19,710
Abso-Fucking-Lutely you know, and the,
the, the real problem with these, uh,

2486
02:14:19,890 --> 02:14:23,700
government, you know, when government
grows is that it very rarely shrinks.

2487
02:14:23,730 --> 02:14:26,760
It doesn't drink. It's expansive.
It's ever expansive in its course.

2488
02:14:26,761 --> 02:14:31,110
If it does two things, it takes taxes and
it passes laws. Do you need that? Yes.

2489
02:14:31,320 --> 02:14:36,090
The question is, what does w w w it's
about proportion. How much is too much?

2490
02:14:36,210 --> 02:14:37,290
That's the question.

2491
02:14:37,620 --> 02:14:41,700
This country was founded on the notion
that government is a necessary evil.

2492
02:14:41,850 --> 02:14:43,020
It doesn't mean you don't have it,

2493
02:14:43,021 --> 02:14:47,100
but stop telling me that government
and equalizing the playing field and

2494
02:14:47,101 --> 02:14:50,220
socially engineering equality is
what makes this country great. No,

2495
02:14:50,221 --> 02:14:54,120
it's butterflying not. The creates
so much resentment and
whenever you have, you know,

2496
02:14:54,121 --> 02:14:57,810
social engineering and, and you, you'd do
it for, you know, like you're like, well,

2497
02:14:57,920 --> 02:15:01,020
I think that affirmative
action is a wonderful idea.

2498
02:15:01,020 --> 02:15:02,070
I think the idea that you know,

2499
02:15:02,071 --> 02:15:04,650
you want to balance everything out
and give black people a chance to,

2500
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:06,840
but whenever you have it set
up for one, I'm like, guys,

2501
02:15:06,841 --> 02:15:08,610
testing for the fire department
or something like that.

2502
02:15:08,820 --> 02:15:12,340
We're a black candidate doesn't have to
score as high as the worst thing is that

2503
02:15:12,341 --> 02:15:16,250
that is the worst thing for any black
person or anybody else. It's true.

2504
02:15:16,540 --> 02:15:20,670
It is assuming and suggesting to a black
person that they can compete mentally.

2505
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:22,500
What does that do to
someone's self esteem?

2506
02:15:22,501 --> 02:15:24,900
What does it do to someone's self worth?
That is the most,

2507
02:15:25,050 --> 02:15:29,310
that is an a is the most insulting. That's
the most racist thing I can think of.

2508
02:15:29,311 --> 02:15:30,850
In fact, it's, well, it's ridiculous.

2509
02:15:31,140 --> 02:15:34,710
Did black people need us to lower the
playing field when it came to sports and

2510
02:15:34,711 --> 02:15:37,590
music? Look what they did with jazz.
Look what they've done with sports.

2511
02:15:37,860 --> 02:15:40,110
Jazz is the highest American art form.

2512
02:15:40,111 --> 02:15:42,690
Expression is primarily
at black expression.

2513
02:15:42,840 --> 02:15:45,230
Did blacks need government
programs for that? No.

2514
02:15:45,250 --> 02:15:48,730
They're just as capable of thinking
what the hell find out and they believe.

2515
02:15:48,731 --> 02:15:51,900
They do believe that it's an
issue that they should have, uh,

2516
02:15:51,990 --> 02:15:56,990
as much as close to an equal number
of people representative as they do in

2517
02:15:57,331 --> 02:16:01,670
society. If it's 10%, it's
close to as they can, but not
look for it when it's not.

2518
02:16:01,690 --> 02:16:05,400
The argument is op is equal. Equality
of opportunity. Oh, you know,

2519
02:16:05,401 --> 02:16:09,090
we know that that what people who are
in the affirmative action camp and I

2520
02:16:09,091 --> 02:16:11,940
understand it, they're saying,
look, we're looking for,

2521
02:16:11,970 --> 02:16:16,320
we're chronic trying to create an equal
opportunity for people and I understand

2522
02:16:16,321 --> 02:16:19,530
that and you do. It is an
uneven playing field. It is.

2523
02:16:19,830 --> 02:16:22,290
But the question is
what do you do about it?

2524
02:16:22,290 --> 02:16:25,230
And you better be very careful when
government comes in with solutions.

2525
02:16:25,590 --> 02:16:29,980
I think the best solution if
possible is to go in real early,

2526
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:32,970
go in and have programs for
kids that are developing in,

2527
02:16:32,971 --> 02:16:36,610
in single family households or single
parent households where they're not

2528
02:16:36,611 --> 02:16:38,470
getting any attention and
they're not getting any love.

2529
02:16:38,471 --> 02:16:41,400
They're not getting any guidance and their
mom has to work and are doing that at

2530
02:16:41,490 --> 02:16:45,790
Harlan, apparently been very
successful. That would be the way.

2531
02:16:45,820 --> 02:16:47,350
There was a guy in Harlem who said,

2532
02:16:47,351 --> 02:16:50,110
we've got to get these kids before
they even get to kindergarten.

2533
02:16:50,111 --> 02:16:51,430
That's the movement.
And he did,

2534
02:16:51,431 --> 02:16:54,310
and he created a program that followed
them from kindergarten all the way

2535
02:16:54,311 --> 02:16:57,550
through college, and it's been, it's
called the Harlem Renaissance Project.

2536
02:16:57,551 --> 02:17:00,040
That's brilliant. That's brilliant.
And it's been amazing. Apparently.

2537
02:17:00,070 --> 02:17:01,860
That's really what it takes. I mean, well,

2538
02:17:01,870 --> 02:17:03,820
you start with someone
when they're 20 man, Mike,

2539
02:17:03,821 --> 02:17:07,540
God so much that you don't do
that. And you have, for example,

2540
02:17:07,541 --> 02:17:08,620
let's just take the black issue.

2541
02:17:08,621 --> 02:17:12,070
If you have a disproportionate number
of black men in jail, for example,

2542
02:17:12,460 --> 02:17:14,740
the problem with that is people
think it's not their problem.

2543
02:17:14,741 --> 02:17:17,590
You're wasting a huge segment of
your population. You're, you're,

2544
02:17:17,770 --> 02:17:22,360
you're not tapping into incredible,
incredible potential that you could be.

2545
02:17:22,540 --> 02:17:26,320
And so the question becomes what you're
right. I think you have to get it when,

2546
02:17:26,321 --> 02:17:30,520
when, when a boy is 14 he's
already lost in some ways. I mean,

2547
02:17:30,521 --> 02:17:32,330
it's very hard.
It's very hard to,

2548
02:17:32,331 --> 02:17:35,200
to kind of figure out how to deal
with that damage. Martial arts,

2549
02:17:35,230 --> 02:17:36,100
who's the best way,

2550
02:17:36,360 --> 02:17:41,360
whatever or whatever is the thing about
martial arts is you have to overcome.

2551
02:17:41,590 --> 02:17:45,550
You overcome great, scary things over and
over and over again. And in doing that,

2552
02:17:45,551 --> 02:17:45,621
uh,

2553
02:17:45,621 --> 02:17:49,240
develops character and builds character
and you almost want to make up for the

2554
02:17:49,241 --> 02:17:51,460
fact that, you know, you were
butterflyed up when you got into this.

2555
02:17:51,460 --> 02:17:54,030
You want to show a big
gap. You know, Josh,

2556
02:17:54,450 --> 02:17:58,480
Josh Waitzkin who was the chess
prodigy. He has a school. Uh, he does,

2557
02:17:58,510 --> 02:18:02,590
he has a school where he teaches
children math. No, I'm sorry, music,

2558
02:18:02,620 --> 02:18:05,730
chess and martial arts. And uh, and,

2559
02:18:05,780 --> 02:18:09,550
and what he does through those
three school, through those three,

2560
02:18:09,551 --> 02:18:11,970
through those three
venues, he, she, he didn't,

2561
02:18:11,980 --> 02:18:16,090
he's not teaching you even the martial
arts and music and the chest is secondary.

2562
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:20,210
Most importantly is you're learning how
to learn. And, and he always says that,

2563
02:18:20,211 --> 02:18:22,510
that he wrote a book about, yeah,
it's a great book. He wrote,

2564
02:18:22,780 --> 02:18:25,850
I recommend everybody called
the art of learning special.

2565
02:18:25,860 --> 02:18:28,900
My friend Nathan and my friend Nathan
got me in contact with them and we've

2566
02:18:28,901 --> 02:18:32,110
exchanged emails back and forth.
And I want to, he's a great guy.

2567
02:18:32,111 --> 02:18:34,630
Him and train with him and when I'm
in New York I want to get them on the

2568
02:18:34,631 --> 02:18:37,300
podcast too. If I met him,
I met him in New York,

2569
02:18:37,301 --> 02:18:40,540
I had a lunch with them and the people
don't know. He's the guy who came up with,

2570
02:18:40,541 --> 02:18:42,320
I mean it was rather, excuse me, the,

2571
02:18:42,321 --> 02:18:46,060
the movie searching for Bobby Fisher
was based on his life, him as a child,

2572
02:18:46,061 --> 02:18:50,440
chess prodigy. And he went from
that to going into Kung Fu.

2573
02:18:50,470 --> 02:18:55,060
He became the king who's hands to
Time Push Hans Kung Fu champion,

2574
02:18:55,061 --> 02:18:57,570
which is a heavy stuff they
do, it's throws and, and, and,

2575
02:18:57,820 --> 02:19:01,780
and he was the first Westerner in China
to win it twice, two times in a row.

2576
02:19:01,781 --> 02:19:06,130
And now he's going to, for the Monday
I was I guess a phene with Jujitsu.

2577
02:19:06,131 --> 02:19:10,510
Now he trains with Marcella Garcia and he,
he developed this website called mg,

2578
02:19:10,540 --> 02:19:14,980
inaction mg and action.com mg being
Marcella Garcia. I believe that's the URL.

2579
02:19:14,981 --> 02:19:18,520
Check it. Marsia Garcia or Marcella Garcia
and action if you want to look at it,

2580
02:19:18,521 --> 02:19:21,460
if you're a Jujitsu fan. And what
the, uh, what the website is,

2581
02:19:21,461 --> 02:19:24,130
is he's broken down Jujitsu
moves just in study them.

2582
02:19:24,131 --> 02:19:27,080
The way he would do chess because
chess is so disciplined, you know,

2583
02:19:27,081 --> 02:19:28,180
just so we were talking about the Trump

2584
02:19:28,180 --> 02:19:28,941
and I mean chess players,

2585
02:19:28,941 --> 02:19:32,450
crap practice constantly and they go over
moves and they go over strategies and

2586
02:19:32,451 --> 02:19:35,240
the, you know, they have maps out
in their head. Well what would he,

2587
02:19:35,241 --> 02:19:38,630
this guy has done is put all
that same discipline to Jujitsu.

2588
02:19:38,960 --> 02:19:42,640
And so he has Marcel Garcia, his entire
repertoire of techniques and you know,

2589
02:19:42,650 --> 02:19:44,360
all sorts of different
sweeps and you know,

2590
02:19:44,361 --> 02:19:47,390
arm bars and all these different
things and in chains and how they go.

2591
02:19:47,391 --> 02:19:50,450
And he has like this website where you
can just sign up and you can learn.

2592
02:19:50,630 --> 02:19:53,210
I mean basically like you and your
friends, you know, if you wanted to,

2593
02:19:53,211 --> 02:19:55,100
you could sign up for it,
get an Internet connection,

2594
02:19:55,101 --> 02:19:58,430
get a laptop and have like a mat and
your living room and you and your buddy

2595
02:19:58,431 --> 02:20:01,870
could learn Jujitsu friends from school.
Man, it's butterflying amazing, man. Yeah,

2596
02:20:02,120 --> 02:20:04,730
I mean, it's amazing. And for
for people that studied Jujitsu,

2597
02:20:04,731 --> 02:20:08,180
it's fascinating because he'll go
over the finer nuances of a technique.

2598
02:20:08,181 --> 02:20:09,710
You're like, butterfly, that's
what I've been doing wrong.

2599
02:20:09,800 --> 02:20:12,020
Because a lot of Jujitsu
is leverage and it's not.

2600
02:20:12,230 --> 02:20:13,550
Most of it's not about strength,

2601
02:20:13,551 --> 02:20:17,300
it's about being in the proper position
and much smaller people can defeat much

2602
02:20:17,301 --> 02:20:18,710
larger people because of the technique,

2603
02:20:19,040 --> 02:20:22,370
but it's like little subtle things that
techniques sometimes you miss and so

2604
02:20:22,371 --> 02:20:25,400
these videos are like real
masters like Marcella Garcia.

2605
02:20:25,401 --> 02:20:28,460
This is like a Sarah Garcia. I
asked, I asked Josh, I was like,

2606
02:20:28,461 --> 02:20:30,680
what's it like to roll with them? Do
you ever get him? You ever catch him?

2607
02:20:30,690 --> 02:20:35,030
And he's like, no, I never get him.
No. He's on another level, man.

2608
02:20:35,240 --> 02:20:40,070
He moves so fast that what it is.
He's so good. He's still sharp,

2609
02:20:40,490 --> 02:20:43,580
so sharp. You can't have
any room for error. See,

2610
02:20:43,581 --> 02:20:46,850
with a lot of Jujitsu it's like how much
room for error you're going to give me.

2611
02:20:47,090 --> 02:20:49,490
Are you going to leave
openings for under hooks?

2612
02:20:49,500 --> 02:20:53,300
Are you going to slip to your back? Are
you going to, you know, let me sweep you.

2613
02:20:53,301 --> 02:20:55,760
Are you going to give up cause you don't
want to fight anymore and go to your

2614
02:20:55,761 --> 02:20:57,080
back and tried to get
them in on your guard.

2615
02:20:57,260 --> 02:20:59,080
It's like there's like a little
battle going on. Like say,

2616
02:20:59,240 --> 02:21:00,920
how much do you have left in the tank?
Well,

2617
02:21:00,921 --> 02:21:02,780
when you get to a level
like Marcella Garcia,

2618
02:21:02,960 --> 02:21:05,450
instead of all that
nonsense in your brain,

2619
02:21:05,540 --> 02:21:10,250
it's this super tuned killing
machine that moves so fast.

2620
02:21:10,251 --> 02:21:13,190
You can't even like, literally, he's
not even thinking about his movements.

2621
02:21:13,191 --> 02:21:16,700
He's drilled them to the point where
they're so pinpoint and precise action.

2622
02:21:16,701 --> 02:21:20,240
It's all reaction idea of getting to
your back. And then before you know it,

2623
02:21:20,241 --> 02:21:24,200
his hooks are in. He's got his arm across
your neck. It's happened in Millis, Josh,

2624
02:21:24,230 --> 02:21:26,530
Josh Waitzkin. Cause that
chunking where, where,

2625
02:21:26,860 --> 02:21:29,920
what he's seen so much that he
can start thinking in chunks,

2626
02:21:29,921 --> 02:21:33,130
like he can think in systems and
you're thinking move to move.

2627
02:21:33,131 --> 02:21:35,600
And He's thinking in a
system like he's thinking in,

2628
02:21:35,601 --> 02:21:38,410
in literally like six move chunks.
Uh,

2629
02:21:38,520 --> 02:21:43,360
and he's also watching you and can, are
already predict what you're going to do.

2630
02:21:43,570 --> 02:21:46,660
And because he's been doing it so long,
he gets into your mind.

2631
02:21:46,750 --> 02:21:50,740
So he's watching you like,
do these clunky,

2632
02:21:51,220 --> 02:21:53,620
here I come, I'm going to do
this. And he goes, I've seen that.

2633
02:21:53,650 --> 02:21:55,870
I've seen that a thousand
times and I'm going to do this,

2634
02:21:55,871 --> 02:21:57,400
but I'm already going
to do this after that.

2635
02:21:57,401 --> 02:22:01,300
And so it's like Josh said that when he
would play chess with guys who weren't

2636
02:22:01,301 --> 02:22:03,760
as advanced as he,
he seen the whole board.

2637
02:22:03,970 --> 02:22:07,150
And the reason he's seeing six or seven
moves ahead of time is because he's able

2638
02:22:07,151 --> 02:22:11,850
to chunk is chunking. He's seeing
things in, in, uh, I dunno,

2639
02:22:11,950 --> 02:22:15,580
I guess that's what he called it. He
just called it like, I'm five, move

2640
02:22:16,110 --> 02:22:19,680
six, move, um, uh, blocks of time.

2641
02:22:19,710 --> 02:22:23,070
That's one of the things about Eddie
style or the way Eddie teaches Eddie

2642
02:22:23,071 --> 02:22:27,030
teachers, instead of just teaching a
move, he teaches a whole chain of moves.

2643
02:22:27,240 --> 02:22:27,601
I killed,

2644
02:22:27,601 --> 02:22:31,560
teach a certain paths to get to a certain
position and then to there and then

2645
02:22:31,561 --> 02:22:35,010
always to a finish. But it's like
four or five moves in advance.

2646
02:22:35,160 --> 02:22:39,390
And sometimes there's, there's alternate
endings or alternate branches. Like,

2647
02:22:39,391 --> 02:22:40,800
what happens if you lose this arm?

2648
02:22:41,010 --> 02:22:42,840
Now you've got to go to
this and then you know,

2649
02:22:42,841 --> 02:22:46,710
so in your mind when you're rolling
and you get to certain specific areas,

2650
02:22:46,830 --> 02:22:49,380
you have this already, Matt, he's
already mapped it out for you. Well,

2651
02:22:49,450 --> 02:22:52,770
it's like the way he teaches. Wow. Yeah.
I think it's a really smart way to do it.

2652
02:22:52,950 --> 02:22:57,120
There's a lot of that with my love. Megan
Love making love making. Tell me more.

2653
02:22:57,210 --> 02:22:58,043
You get an echo.

2654
02:22:59,540 --> 02:23:01,970
Did you, you channeling Craig
Shoemaker, is that what I'm doing?

2655
02:23:01,971 --> 02:23:05,740
A careful to love master
or any of his stuff? No,

2656
02:23:06,690 --> 02:23:10,080
old school.
Speaking of standard,

2657
02:23:10,960 --> 02:23:13,750
what are you up for?
Three hours. We've been,

2658
02:23:13,751 --> 02:23:17,460
we've been talking for three hours and
I got that long. We didn't start on,

2659
02:23:17,500 --> 02:23:19,960
it's like three 30,
but it might've been our best

2660
02:23:20,010 --> 02:23:23,940
podcast ever. Thank you to all the people
that are listening. Thank you very much.

2661
02:23:23,941 --> 02:23:24,780
We really appreciate it.

2662
02:23:24,781 --> 02:23:28,770
We appreciate all the kind words on
Twitter and all that good shit. And, um,

2663
02:23:28,830 --> 02:23:32,880
you know, we love doing it
and I'm glad you guys enjoy
it. And it's, uh, there's a,

2664
02:23:33,030 --> 02:23:34,050
you know,
I'm,

2665
02:23:34,051 --> 02:23:38,520
I'm getting in contact with a fascinating
group of human beings through Twitter,

2666
02:23:38,730 --> 02:23:40,410
through the message board,
through Facebook. Yeah.

2667
02:23:40,411 --> 02:23:43,200
There's a few douchebags slipped through
the cracks, but for the most part,

2668
02:23:43,201 --> 02:23:46,560
there's a lot of really
interesting people. And you
know, I said that about, uh,

2669
02:23:46,590 --> 02:23:48,990
what are you playing in the
background? Crazy. Hm. What does that,

2670
02:23:48,991 --> 02:23:52,590
that's butterflying grants. It sounds
terrible. Stop that. Shuts the bangles.

2671
02:23:52,591 --> 02:23:57,480
Walk like an Egyptian isn't. Yeah,
stop it Brian. Just stop it. Cut It.

2672
02:23:57,481 --> 02:23:59,220
Loose pride. Anyway, thank you everybody.

2673
02:23:59,221 --> 02:24:03,060
We appreciate it all very much and we
enjoyed doing it and uh, you know, um,

2674
02:24:03,120 --> 02:24:06,240
I'm a very lucky person and I'm very lucky
to have people like Brian Cowen in my

2675
02:24:06,241 --> 02:24:07,950
life because, uh, you know, it's a,

2676
02:24:07,951 --> 02:24:11,850
it makes life very interesting to have
